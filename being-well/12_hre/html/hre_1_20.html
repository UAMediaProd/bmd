											<p>Being respectful in any relationship means accepting the dignity and worth of
												the other person and that person accepting you.</p>
											<pod-quote>
												<p><em>When someone supports a decision or choice that you are making that
														they may not agree with, that shows respect. They could have spoken
														up, or they could have put you down and made you feel worthless or
														stupid until you changed your mind, but instead they respected you
														and supported your wishes.</em></p>

										<node-content>
											<p>Open and honest communication is essential to all healthy relationships. Remember, communication isn't just words, but our body language, posture, facial expressions and tone of voice, or even our silence.</p>
											<pod-quote>
												<p><em>Having the ability to say when something is good or when it is wrong,
														that's real dedication. Communication like that is hard. Being able
														to tell your friend that they're being shitty and not letting things
														build up, that's real communication.</em></p>

										<node-heading>Equality</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Feeling equal has been shown to be a key predictor of relationship satisfaction. Relatively equal shares of power and decision-making not only makes the relationship healthy, it can also mean individuals feel supported and empowered to challenge themselves in other areas of their lives.</p>
											<pod-quote>
												<p><em>You have an understanding of expectations, and what each other wants. There's no power stuff going on. Someone may be the leader, but no one is the boss.</em></p>

										<node-heading>Freedom and enthusiasm</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>You want to be around people who want to be around you! Being a free and
												enthusiastic friend or partner means that you are excited and energised in
												that relationship and you have chosen freely to be there.</p>
											<pod-quote>
												<p><em>People should choose to share their lives out of a want rather than a
														need. Too many people get caught up in making their partner their
														one and only and that can block off everyone else and make it feel
														like an obligation not a choice.</em></p>

										<node-content>
											<p>Our connections with other people should be things that bring us satisfaction
												and joy. Whether it's a friend we share a hobby with or a partner who has
												the same dreams for the future, there needs to be lightness and laughter in
												our relationships.</p>
											<pod-quote>
												<p><em>Life's too short not to laugh. When I'm with my true friends, I feel
														safe to be 100% myself. It's a safe place to share and a great place
														to laugh.</em></p>

							<p>The most important thing to remember here is that healthy relationships are not necessarily
								perfect relationships. Friends and couples can argue or disagree. People who love each other
								still frustrate each other, let each other down and get on each other's nerves. In healthy
								relationships, it is the way these differences and challenges are expressed and negotiated
								with mutual <glossary content="<p>Giving agreement to do something, or permission for something to happen. Consent is a vital component in all forms of social and physical interaction.</p><p>Sexual consent must be asked for and received; it cannot just be assumed. Affirmative consent is when the verbal and physical cues a person is giving show that they are comfortable, in agreement, and want to continue (remember, consent requires freedom, capacity and choice).</p>">consent</glossary> and respectful communication that makes all the difference.</p>

							<p>It's also important to consider that when so much of our communication and interaction occurs online, these relationships can be just as complex in their dynamics as 'offline' or 'real world' relationships. These relationships can have all of the same healthy and unhealthy aspects, but online communication can also have the added difficulty of the absence of non-verbal cues that form so much of our overall understanding of communication.</p>

							<p>Being in a healthy relationship doesn't mean you have to live all the same things or spend each moment together. Friends and couples who have healthy relationships remain themselves, with their own interests and ideas, but are able to respect the differences in those around them, and support them and empower them to be the best they can be.</p>
