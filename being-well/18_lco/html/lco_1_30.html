							<p>If they are not already included in your rent costs, bill payments can add quite a lot to the overall cost of accommodation. Students have found different ways to manage their bills, from using apps to split the costs, to setting up a shared bank account specifically for bill payments.</p>

Attempt the activity a few times to get a better understanding of different living situations.</p></instructional-text>

									<action-question>Chloe has more expenses and less income now that she is a full-time student and supporting her children herself. For example, she needs to pay for extra childcare whilst studying. Does she need to create a new budget?</action-question>

									<h4>Working out a budget</h4>
									<p>Chloe should re-calculate her budget based on her Centrelink payments and income from employment. She should work out how much of her childcare costs will be covered by the Child Care Subsidy that she is able to get through Centrelink as a single parent, and how much she will need to contribute herself. She could research the best deals for her energy and internet, and switch suppliers to get a better rate. She may need to make a tough decision to cut back on some of her non-essential expenditure, and even some of her children's activities to manage monthly outgoings.</p>

									<h4>Financial challenges</h4>
									<p>Many students find full-time study financially challenging, and without careful budgeting it is easy to get behind with payments. Single parents who are in receipt of Centrelink may see changes in what they receive once they are a full-time student. Chloe has made some difficult decisions about lifestyle changes, which will affect her family in order to bring her costs down. Childcare is a particular issue, but she may be able to get additional Child Care Subsidy as she is studying. Planning and budgeting are key here.</p>

								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="8" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Part-time study</h4>
									<p>Studying part-time may make it possible for Chloe to carry on working whilst studying, and limit the amount of extra childcare she needs.

								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="9" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Distance learning</h4>
									<p>Many higher education institutions, as well as Open Universities Australia, offer distance learning options. This provides a great amount of flexibility, allowing students to study at times that fit with their other commitments. In many cases, this means working, studying and family commitments can work alongside one another, whilst limiting some of the other costs of studying, such as commuting and child care. She may still be eligible for a Centrelink payment, so if Chloe chose this option she would need to check and make sure her income would cover her costs.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I'd never had to pay a bill before in my life, so it was a bit of a shock when I found out that I was responsible for paying other bills as well as my rent! The best tip I can give is don't ignore your bills, and don't be afraid to ask for help and advice if you are struggling to pay them.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>Working out how to pay the bills when I moved to a shared house was a bit of a challenge. I had to be really honest about what I could afford and not worry about telling the others when I couldn't afford a payment. We figured out a budget for everyone, so it meant we never fell out over the bills.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>Paying the bills always led to massive arguments in our house because we hadn't really thought it through. There was always someone who couldn't pay their share and it put pressure on everyone else. So, we did a bit of research online and took some advice to set aside an equal amount of money each week, and now we use that to pay the shared bills. It has reduced the number of arguments we have!</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>We had a kitty for the household items that we shared, like loo paper and cleaning stuff. On the whole that worked well. Some friends had a rota for buying those sorts of items so that no one felt they were always buying for everyone.</p></pod-quote>

Jenna calculated how much the broadband, water, gas and electricity bills and TV licence would total for the year, and worked out how much each person would need to pay a month. Each student has agreed to pay &pound;50 a month into the account. Consider the different scenarios, answer the questions and then continue on for feedback</p></instructional-text-accessible>

										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>Although Jenna has genuine concerns about the account &ndash; after all, it's in her name &ndash; she would be better to discuss this calmly with the others and come up with some solutions together. They will need to discuss how this happened and why they didn't let one another know that there was a problem. Importantly, they need to ensure this is unlikely to happen again, maybe by agreeing to review the account and bills together every month.</note-feedback>

											<p>Can you think of any solutions to this situation? </p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>It is important that the housemates who have missed their payments top up the account as soon as possible. But Rhian has lost her job and may not be able to do this. Although one of the others might be willing to lend her the money for the time being, this is not necessarily a possibility. Anyway, if Rhian can't pay them back then this could lead to more bad feelings. If a bill can't be paid, it is really important to contact the company concerned and let them know. Often a temporary payment plan can be arranged. If this is more than a short-term issue, and Henri and Rhian are going to struggle to pay the fortnightly amount, they should consider contacting student services for budgeting advice and see if they are able to apply for any financial assistance.</note-feedback>

Oliver suggested that they look at some of the apps that help with shared bills, and the housemates agreed that this would be a good move. Henri paid in the money he owed and admitted it had slipped his mind. Rhian was struggling with her money but student services has helped her with budgeting and financial assistance. The university careers service has also helped her and she is applying for other jobs. Jenna now lets everyone know how the account is looking every month.</note-feedback>
