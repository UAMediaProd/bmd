00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Since moving out of
home, I've noticed

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that I do tend to just stick to
stuff that I know how to make,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:90%
that's easy, and affordable.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of my
university studies,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.128 align:middle line:84%
my eating habits have
changed a little bit.

00:00:22.128 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Initially, when I
was in high school,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I used to eat a
lot of junk food.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lot of
chocolate, a lot of chips.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:84%
That kept up with part of
my first year of university

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:90%
studies.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I
entered my third year,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I found that I started to
eat healthier or at least,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
reduced the amount of snacking.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, some of my eating
preferences have changed.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I think, certainly,
money factors

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
into a lot of the way
that-- the food I shop,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:90%
and what I cook and eat.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think, healthy,
fast quick, cheap meals

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
are what my diet's of
changed to at university.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
My eating habits have definitely
changed since I moved to uni.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
These days, I'm looking for
a really quick and easy meals

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
that I can cook up.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And generally, I
want those done--

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
eaten and cooked
within half an hour so

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I can get on with my day.
