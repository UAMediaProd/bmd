							<flashcards class="with-images">
								<flashcard size="large" class="card-1">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading"> Keep personal information in the public domain professional </flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">Although content and images can be removed, it's not always easy, as things can be reposted or shared. It's best practice to consider everything you post as permanent. Try to think about who might see what you share or post, and if you'd be happy for others (including potential employers) to see it, or if it may be offensive. </flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading"> Understand your privacy settings </flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text"> Most social media platforms have privacy settings, although they can be hard to find! It may seem tedious to check your privacy settings on all the apps and websites you use, but if they aren't secure, hackers could take advantage of your information from your browsing history.
									</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading"> Purchasing from secure sites </flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text"> When buying online only give your bank details and address to secure, encrypted websites. Secure sites have a URL that starts with https: rather than simply http:. Often they have a padlock icon next to the address bar. If you are unsure about a site or it looks suspicious, don't give your details.
									</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading"> Passwords protect </flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text"> It's important to think about using a strong password and using different passwords for different apps and sites, rather than using the same one over and over again. If you are worried about remembering all the passwords, password manager software can help. Make sure your internet connection is secure. If you are using public WiFi avoid doing things like online banking or shopping, as your passwords and details could be stolen. It's better to do these sorts of tasks when connected to a secure WiFi network.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large" class="card-5">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading"> Anti-virus and anti-malware software </flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text"> Anti-virus software needs to be kept up to date, but correctly installed internet security software can help detect and remove most malware. However, it won't protect you from everything. Only download apps, music and videos from a site you trust. Your university should be able to help you with good choices for anti-virus and anti-malware software, and there are many free applications available.
									</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Fingerprint access </flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text"> Many newer devices now have fingerprint access to make them more secure. However, sometimes people allow other people's fingerprints (friends, partners, etc.) to be stored on their devices. Think about whether this is necessary and who has access. Someone you might trust at the moment might not be so trustworthy in the future.
									</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large" class="card-7">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Multi-factor authentication</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method in which a device only grants access after the user successfully presents two or more pieces of evidence (or factors). This could be an additional passcode, or a code that is emailed for one-time access. This kind of software is commonly used by businesses.</flashcard-back>

							<p>While there are precautions you can take to operate more safely, it's important to note that it is often the actions of other people that can cause us problems online, rather than the technology itself.</p>
							<p>Many relationships have an online element, whether it's checking in with a friend or partner over social media, or enjoying a relationship online with someone you've never met in the 'real world'. It's important to consider the signs that interactions might be unsafe or lacking respect, whatever type of relationship it may be.</p>

										<mcq-question><p>In a new relationship one partner says, "My last partner cheated on me. It's made me feel a bit insecure; can I track you?"</p></mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's OK for your partner to track you.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>It's never OK for your partner to track you.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's OK for your partner to track you if they are insecure.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>Faced with this disclosure in a new relationship it may be hard to say "no" but it's important to remember that healthy relationships are based on honesty and trust, not control. Tracking someone is an invasion of their privacy.

										<mcq-question><p>My pictures always receive more likes when I add my location. I'm not too concerned about this because all of my accounts are private. </p></mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's never worth worrying about posting your location online.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's sometimes important to be cautious when you post your location.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>It's always important to think twice before you share your location online.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>Sharing your location online can be risky, even if you use privacy settings. Though it may be tempting to post on social media whilst you are on holiday, you should consider the message this gives to your followers: that you are away from home and your property is empty. In extreme cases, sharing your location could make you more vulnerable to potential stalking and harassment behaviour. We discuss this in more detail later in the module.</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question><p>When using online dating apps it's a good idea to use your Facebook and Instagram photos.</p></mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's a good idea to use these photos so people can check you are who you say you are.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's sometimes a good idea as it saves you having to take new photos.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>It's not a good idea to use the same photos.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>It is best to keep online dating apps and platforms separate from your social media profiles so that you can't easily be identified 'in real life' until you are ready. Keep any personal details to a minimum and Google yourself to check what additional information about you is online.</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question><p>During your course, you may use informal platforms such as WhatsApp, where both tutors and students are included in group chats. </p></mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>Group chats are always safe because they are encrypted.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's not a good idea to have tutors and students on the same group chat.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Whatever the group chat is on it's important people communicate respectfully.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>Using social media is increasingly common to communicate, discuss and arrange aspects of university life. Using group chats is safe provided all those using them understand the importance of communicating respectfully and civilly. However, do not assume chats are private, as there have been many cases of student disciplinary action from inappropriate conversations in group chats.

										<mcq-question><p>Your friend receives an anonymous message via their Instagram account, saying "I like the way you've styled your hair today".</p></mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's fine &ndash; it's complimenting her hair.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option>
												<mcq-answer>It's anonymous so it doesn't matter.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>This could be unsettling and a cause for concern.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>Whilst the content of the message itself doesn't seem offensive, it could be frightening to receive an anonymous message like this and know that someone is watching you. This could be considered harassment if it is part of a pattern. Keeping a social media account private reduces the number of people who can see photos and send messages.</mcq-feedback>

							<p>Universities have a duty of care to act reasonably in students' best interests, to protect their wellbeing and provide appropriate support. If you have any concerns about someone who is contacting you in a way that makes you feel frightened or uncomfortable, or you know of someone who is being contacted in such a way, you can report unwanted behaviours or block them. Most social media platforms now offer these services to help protect users.</p>
