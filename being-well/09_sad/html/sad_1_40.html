							<p>There are lots of day-to-day things you can do to keep yourself healthy, feeling well, energised and positive about your life. Here are just a few ideas to get you thinking about how to look after yourself if you feel stressed or anxious. You might like to add them to your action plan at the end of the module. These helpful behaviours are often called self-care. If we practise them regularly we might reduce how likely we are to feel stressed or anxious in the first place.</p>

                                        <p>Taking care of ourselves is something we can all do, although there will be times in our lives when it is more or less difficult to do so. This includes resting and getting enough sleep. When we feel very stressed or anxious it can be easy to forget that there are things we can do to make ourselves feel better (and more in control of the situation).</p>

                                            <p>Don't forget to eat, sleep, rest and communicate with other people regularly. Getting sufficient rest is important for physical and mental wellbeing, and eating balanced meals (with fresh ingredients where possible) will help keep up energy levels for a busy student timetable. Taking time off and chatting with friends or family will help keep things in perspective, and provide a much-needed moment to relax.</p>

                                            <p>Think about when you study, and try not to leave it all to the last minute. Avoid working overnight if possible, as our brains need sleep to process learning, and a lack of sleep will affect your memory. Sensible studying means better academic outcomes, and less stress. This topic is explored in the module titled: <em>Studying well</em>.</p>

                                            <p>Activity doesn't have to mean running marathons, or cycling everywhere if that's not your thing. Look at ways you can be active that fit with your lifestyle and abilities. The key here is to work off some of the stress and anxiety as well as boosting our happy hormones (endorphins). It may mean sport, or walking rather than taking the bus, but it can also mean yoga and muscle toning. Just do something! This topic is explored in the module titled: <em>Being active</em>.</p>

                                            <p>Mindfulness (a form of meditation and relaxation), gratitude (feeling thankful for the good things in life) and savouring (actively appreciating enjoyable activities) are all positive activities that may help you to feel calm. Some universities have mindfulness or meditation groups. There are also apps to guide you. To learn more about mindfulness, check the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod. You could try writing positive feelings and activities down each day. This is similar to journaling, where you write what went well and take the time to reflect on it.</p>

                                            <p>This is useful if you feel yourself getting increasingly anxious or worried. You can use distraction techniques wherever you are, and no one will realise. One popular technique uses the five senses. To distract yourself from the source of your anxiety or panic, focus instead on one thing you can see, hear, taste, smell, and touch or feel. You can repeat this if you need to. It is a quick and memorable way to look after yourself at a difficult moment, such as before an exam or a presentation.</p>

							<p>It can sometimes feel overwhelming to be given so many suggestions. The next activity will allow you some time to consider the options you have read about. Think about how confident you feel to try them, and which ones you will add to your own personalised action plan at the end of the module.</p>
							<p>Remember that it is better to do a few small things often to keep well, than try to do lots of things at once!</p>
							
							<instructional-text><p>Rate the statements according to your level of interest in trying them to manage stress or anxiety. Click on the 'I already do this' button, and select all the suggestions that belong in this category. Then repeat the process for 'I will try this', 'I would need support to do this', and 'I'm not likely to do this'.</p></instructional-text>

							<p>You should hopefully have reflected on yourself and your own wellbeing. You may even have been inspired to try something new or different to boost your emotional health.</p>
							<p>If you would like to try some of these ideas but might need support, organise an appointment with a university counsellor or your GP. By being proactive about our health we can potentially do better at university and in life than if we wait until things go wrong before we act.</p>
