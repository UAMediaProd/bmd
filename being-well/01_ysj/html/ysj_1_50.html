									<h4>Asking good questions</h4>
									<p>When you are focusing on being interested in others rather than worrying about
										whether you are interesting, then your first key strategy is asking good questions.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Closed questions </strong>are the kind with yes/no or simple factual answers,
										which control the direction of the conversation and tend to 'shut it down'.</p>
									<p><strong>Open questions </strong>are more general and allow the person to open up and
										make their own choices about the direction of the conversation.</p>
								</process-page>
								<!-- notemaking -->
								<process-page>
									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>Try writing some examples of closed questions and open questions.</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Here are some examples of closed and open questions. </p>
											<p><strong>Closed questions</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li>"Where are you from?"</li>
												<li>"Are you OK?"</li>
												<li>"Do you like...?"</li>
												<li>"Have you read the seminar prep?"</li>
											</ul>
											<p><strong>Open questions</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li>"How are you finding things so far?"</li>
												<li>"How are you doing?"</li>
												<li>"What are you into...?"</li>
												<li>"What did you think of the seminar prep?"</li>
											</ul>
										</note-feedback>
									</note-making>
								</process-page>
								<process-page next-btn-always-active="true">
									<h4>Empathy</h4>
									<p>Empathy is imagining what it might feel like if you were in someone else's situation.
										It means being interested in the other person &ndash; wanting to really 'get it'
										from their perspective, rather than being quick to turn the attention onto yourself.
									</p>
									<p>You don't need to agree with what someone is saying in order to demonstrate empathy
										or compassion for what they are experiencing. Some people stereotype empathy as a
										'weak' characteristic, but empathy is demonstrated by some of our strongest leaders.
									</p>
								</process-page>
								<!-- notemaking -->
								<process-page>
									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>How can you demonstrate empathy through your body language? </p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>If you are focusing on really understanding the other person's point of view, your body language will automatically show this and you won't need to make artificial changes to convey empathy.</p>
											<p>Empathic and inclusive body language will include:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Natural eye contact</li>
												<li>Nods and other encouraging gestures</li>
												<li>Open body posture (arms not folded)</li>
												<li>Kind and calm facial expression</li>
												<li>Respecting cultural norms about boundaries and personal space</li>
												<li>Ensuring any physical contact is mutually comfortable and agreed, e.g. a
													handshake or hug.</li>
											</ul>
										</note-feedback>
									</note-making>
								</process-page>
								<process-page next-btn-always-active="true">
									<h4>Showing you are listening</h4>
									<p>Your body language will show when you are listening empathically, but you can also
										show that you are listening by what you <em>don't</em> do. This includes not jumping
										in with your own opinions, and not trying to 'fix it' or provide solutions too
										quickly.</p>
									<p>A powerful way to show you are listening is by checking back with the person that you
										have understood what they are saying, using paraphrasing. Paraphrasing means
										repeating back the key points about what you have heard, especially focusing on the
										feelings or what seems most important to the person, or even on what is not
										explicitly said.</p>
								</process-page>
								<!-- notemaking -->
								<process-page>
									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>Can you think of at least three ways to introduce your paraphrasing comments?
											</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Examples of ways to introduce your paraphrasing comments include:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>"It sounds like..."</li>
												<li>"I get the sense that..."</li>
												<li>"I can really see how much that means to you..."</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Paraphrasing can work well in combination with open questions to check if
												you have understood correctly or to ask the person to expand further. </p>
										</note-feedback>
									</note-making>
								</process-page>
								<process-page next-btn-always-active="true">
									<h4>Mindfulness &ndash; listening to yourself </h4>
									<p>Listening well to others is an important communication skill, but so is listening to
										<em>yourself</em>. This means tuning in to check out what you are feeling and
										knowing what you want and don't want. Then you can make informed decisions about
										what you would like others to know, do or not do. This is easier to do in specific
										situations if you regularly reflect on your current values and sense of identity
										(see the screen titled: <em>Finding your belonging</em>).</p>
									<p>A good skill for learning to tune in to yourself is mindfulness. Mindfulness means
										paying conscious attention to what you are experiencing in the present moment, with
										an attitude of curiosity and openness.</p>
								</process-page>
								<!-- notemaking -->
								<process-page>
									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>Set a timer for one minute and focus on your breath. Afterwards, write down
												what other thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations you became aware of in
												that minute. </p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>If you were able to focus only on your breath without becoming aware of lots
												of other random thoughts and feelings then you are very unusual! Mindfulness
												helps us recognise how 'busy' our minds can be from moment to moment.</p>
											<p>Sometimes we will become aware of uncomfortable thoughts or feelings. If this
												happens to you, try to just notice and name the feelings without trying to
												'fix' them straight away. This can be a powerful skill to avoid getting too
												caught up in negative feelings. (See the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for
												more information about mindfulness.)</p>
										</note-feedback>
									</note-making>
								</process-page>
								<process-page next-btn-always-active="true">
									<h4>Using 'I' statements instead of blame </h4>
									<p>Using an 'I' statement focuses on what you feel or the impact on you of what someone
										else has said or done. Tuning in and listening to yourself will help you formulate
										'I' statements, which clearly communicate your feelings or opinions to others. This
										is a good alternative to blaming statements like "You always...".</p>
									<p>Simply stating your feelings can help to alleviate any difficult feelings. This is not about being selfish or self-centred. It makes space for open discussion with others where they can also be encouraged to share their own 'I' statements. This can help reduce tension in a constructive way.</p>
								</process-page>
								<!-- notemaking -->
								<process-page>
									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>Note down some 'I' statements to address someone else's behaviour that causes
												you stress or difficulty.</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Can you see the difference in impact of the following statements?</p>
											<p><strong>General statement/judgement</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li>"That music is rubbish" </li>
												<li>"This is too hard" </li>
												<li>"You are so selfish"</li>
												<li>"The lecturer marks unfairly"</li>
											</ul>
											<p><strong>'I' statement</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li>"I really enjoy [name favourite music]... " </li>
												<li>"I get discouraged when I don't understand things straight away"</li>
												<li>"I get really stressed when you play your music loudly and I can't
													get to sleep"</li>
												<li>"I feel disappointed and confused about my grade on this paper."</li>
											</ul>
										</note-feedback>
									</note-making>
								</process-page>
								<process-page next-btn-always-active="true">
									<h4>Communicating assertively</h4>
									<p>Assertiveness means communicating clearly and directly, while remaining respectful.
										This is especially relevant when you are stating your own preferences or making
										requests of others. Start with an 'I' statement, acknowledge the other person's
										perspective (where relevant) and then state what you would like them to know or do.
									</p>

									<p>Assertiveness brings together all the other communication skills, and helps you
										state your boundaries and say a clear "no" when necessary. It is best to state facts
										rather than making judgements. It may be necessary to repeat yourself, but it is
										best not to make excuses or justifications.</p>
								</process-page>
								<!-- notemaking -->
								<process-page next-btn-always-active="true">
									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>What kind of body language conveys assertive communication?</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Assertive strategies include:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Taking steady breaths</li>
												<li>Using a firm and audible tone of voice, without shouting or using an
													aggressive tone</li>
												<li>Looking the other person respectfully in the eye</li>
												<li>Standing or sitting tall</li>
												<li>A relaxed and open posture.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>(See the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for more information about assertive
												communication.)</p>

									<p>Empathy and good listening and communication skills can also be applied to unspoken
										communication. For example, if you notice that someone in your class is looking
										stressed, you could show empathy and good listening/questioning skills by saying,
										"You've been looking stressed out lately [empathy], and I am concerned about you [I
										statement]. What can I do to help? [open question]".</p>
