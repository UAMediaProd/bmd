									<p>Although it isn't your intention, pointing out to your friends when they are being
										self-critical can feel like you are criticising them. You might need to be a little more subtle.</p>
									<p>When they say something self-critical you could ask, "Would you say that to me?"
										Usually the answer is no, so ask why they are saying it about themselves. You can
										then have a shared discussion about how they are kinder and have more realistic
										expectations of you than they do of themselves: "You're a great friend to me, can
										you be a more compassionate friend to yourself?"</p>

									<h4>In a tutorial with unfamiliar students</h4>
									<p>Layla has a different opinion to the other students. Rather than expressing her
										view, Layla is focusing inwards on her anxiety about speaking up. Layla knows how to
										confidently express her opinions, but in a less familiar environment she also needs
										to employ a strategy to recognise and overcome her NATs. Being aware of the NATs and
										the fact that she has a choice of behaviour is often enough to feel more confident.
										Or to build up confidence, she could offer a theoretical different opinion (if she
										is not yet confident of owning it) or ask the group to think of alternative opinions
										to the dominant one.</p>

									<h4>In a comfortable space</h4>
									<p>Kit is proudly explaining to a group of students that the flag they are carrying is
										the transgender flag. Kit feels confident in doing this because it is Transgender
										Awareness Week on campus, and it is a supportive atmosphere. Kit's self-esteem has
										risen this week as they have felt part of a community and accepted by those the
										campaign has sought to educate. Because Kit and others in the community have felt
										more confident and resilient to be themselves, the campaign week has consequently
										been very successful.</p>

									<h4>Around strangers</h4>
									<p>Off campus, Kit is asked by a group of rowdy men what the flag indicates. Mindful of the prejudice of others and fearful how the group might respond, Kit mumbles something about it being a faded flag of Thailand and hurries on. Kit is aware of the increased violence directed towards the trans community, so their actions here are logical. However, Kit feels terrible for not speaking up and consequently NATs kick in (e.g. "I've let my community down"). Thinking how they would respond to a friend in that situation is a good strategy for Kit to adopt to combat their NATs. Kit would be much more compassionate and understanding of the circumstances and reassure the friend that they did the right thing in prioritising their personal safety.</p>

									<h4>Being a part of a group</h4>
									<p>Adam's team has just won an important match. He feels part of the team and easily able to talk about the intricacies of the game and praise his teammates for their performances. Adam, who is quite a shy student, is even able to crack a joke in the changing rooms, which everyone laughs at. He does not consciously realise he is utilising strategies, but he is modelling the behaviour of his teammates to help him become (and feel) part of the group. He does this through mirroring their body language and actions (high fives, hugs, handshakes) and contributing with the same sense of humour. He praises his teammates' performance and accepts their compliments as to how he played.</p>

									<h4>Feeling on the outside</h4>
									<p>As a celebration for the team's victory, Adam and his teammates are now in the pub. The close connection Adam felt with his teammates earlier in the day has ebbed away. To start with he chatted to others about the game, but now the conversation has moved on from hockey and he feels lost. His NATs come in and Adam feels that he does not belong in the group (e.g. "outside of the hockey changing room, I don't think these guys will like me"). A great strategy to overcome social NATs is to actively listen to others. By that we mean properly listen to what others say and reflect it back to them, so they know they have been heard. Using open questions is also helpful, as most people like talking about themselves. For more information on open questions, see the module titled: <em>Your student journey.</em></p>

									<h4>Speaking up when support is available</h4>
									<p>Ruby and her best friend, Tess, are sitting in the library, quietly working on their respective assignments. Three first years are messing around near them and causing a distraction. After talking it over with Tess, Ruby calmly but assertively asks them to quieten down or leave as people are trying to concentrate on their work. Ruby feels nervous about asking them as she is fearful of a confrontation, but she feels supported by Tess, which helps build her confidence to speak to the younger students. They apologise for the noise and pack up their things and leave. Ruby feels proud of herself for handling the situation well.</p>

									<h4>Speaking up when alone</h4>
									<p>Ruby is sitting in the library working on an assignment that is due in one hour. There is another student right across from her who is talking loudly on her mobile phone. Ruby wants to ask them to be quiet, but, being on her own, she does not feel able to. Her self-talk is quite negative in this moment and it is preventing her from speaking up. A good strategy here for Ruby would be to refer to a previous time she had politely asked someone to be quiet. This should provide her with more confidence as, if she did it once, she could do it again. Being on her own, without backup, seems to be the crucial difference in stopping her from acting. Ruby could rehearse what she would say to the student and, the more she focuses on that, the easier it will be for her to visualise that she can do it. Even if they don't quieten down, it is likely Ruby would feel better about herself for expressing her valid view.</p>

							<p>How confident and resilient we feel depends on lots of factors &ndash; who we are with, the
								environment, our familiarity with the situation and how we are feeling at that moment.</p>
							<p>A helpful strategy is to recognise actions that make us feel good, and then apply those same
								actions and behaviours to moments when we feel challenged. The wider we expand our range of
								manageable situations, the more we increase our confidence and resilience skill set.</p>

Perhaps you choose a courtroom where the prosecuting lawyer is confident you are wrong, but your defence lawyer is building up the positive case. Whatever works for you: the important thing is to become aware of your thoughts and the importance of your self-talk, and to learn that it is malleable.</p>

								<h4>Who helps to build your self-esteem and confidence?</h4>
								<p>Your supporters are not just those you ask for help with the serious things in life. The people who make you laugh or who you exercise with or go to gigs with are just as important to help you build up your self-esteem and confidence. Spend more time with people who make you feel better, stronger and happier.</p>
								<p><strong>Hint: </strong>Think about who you like to spend time with. Who has supported you before when things have been difficult? Who do you help out when they are struggling?</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Where are the places you feel most 'at home' with yourself?</h4>
								<p>Spend more time in environments where you feel better. If being in nature or in your favourite coffee shop improves your sense of wellbeing, then factor this into your schedule. Spending time in places that increase your confidence and self-esteem is key to building your resilience.</p>
								<p><strong>Hint: </strong>Think about where you feel comfortable. This might involve the places special people live or spend time, but it will also include venues and physical locations. If you're not sure, think about which are the places you have gone to before when you have needed a break from work.</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>What helps you to prepare for a challenging situation?</h4>
								<p>Think about the things you can do to prepare yourself for challenging situations (for example, an important exam or a big party if you feel socially anxious). Sleeping, drinking enough water and eating well are all basic things that can help. Exercise is also helpful, as is time for relaxation and socialising. Remember that you will still be nervous in certain situations even if you are well prepared, but working smartly in a task-based, not time-based way can help.</p>
								<p><strong>Hint: </strong>Reflect on what you have done previously to prepare for important events. Ask yourself what has worked before. Who has helped you before?</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Think about a time you coped well in a challenging situation. What strategies did you use?</h4>
								<p>How you act will change how you think, just as how you think will change how you act. Think about past events and how your actions have helped to increase your sense of self and self-confidence. It can be hard to think about positive actions, as it is often easier to remember what went wrong, rather than what went right. However, it is important that you spend time recognising that, when you have succeeded previously, you have taken an action.</p>
								<p><strong>Hint: </strong>Some of these strategies might seem small to you (e.g. during a presentation you made sure you made eye contact with the audience, or stood up straighter to imply confidence), but they all make a positive difference. What behaviours do you notice in yourself?</p>

							<p>Being mindful of what helps within your own pyramid of resourcefulness is important to help
								you manage the fluctuations in your confidence, self-esteem and resilience. It can be hard
								to remember what has helped before, which is why it is good to keep a tangible record. The
								<em>Action plan</em> screen at the end of the module will help with this.</p>
							<p>There will always be challenging situations and being in one is not a sign of failure or
								weakness. Managing these times can be emotionally draining which is why it is important to
								spend time where you feel comfortable and with people who help you feel stronger.</p>
