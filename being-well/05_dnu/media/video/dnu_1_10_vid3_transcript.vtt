Pasta with a sauce that is made from tomatoes, garlic, onion, olives, maybe some eggplant or zucchini. And that's, pretty much, it.

Probably a poke bowl. I find it's a really quick, easy way to just get a lot of different veggies and sources of nutritional food in one place, one hit.

I think the key for me, especially throughout university, has really been about keeping it simple. So I'll make sure I have good basics on hand like a hummus or an eggplant dip, both of which are readily available at supermarkets. But are also really cheap and simple to make at home. And I can toss them in some wraps or into a salad with some roasted vegetables on the side. And that's really easy.

The other thing is if I've got some time on a Sunday or during the week, I'll batch cook. So I'll make a big vegetarian chili, which I can have for dinners throughout the week.

My personal go-to meal I can prepare in a very short time is a can of tuna and boil vegetable.
