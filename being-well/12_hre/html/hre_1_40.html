							<p>Being the person that speaks up about unhealthy behaviour is never easy, but bystanders can have a huge amount of power to effect positive change.</p>
							<p>Depending on your personality and the situation, as a bystander there are four recognised tactics you may employ to intervene in a situation:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Direct actions</strong>: acknowledging and dealing with the situation as it stands at the time</li>
									<li><strong>Indirect actions</strong>: empowering or engaging others to intervene in the situation, or taking steps without directly intervening</li>
									<li><strong>Delayed actions</strong>: following up with an intervention after a situation has passed, but with the aim of repairing or managing harm </li>
									<li><strong>Distraction</strong>: attempting to divert or disrupt a situation &ndash; often through humour &ndash; but not engaging with the situation directly.</li>
								</ul>

									<pod-quote><p>My advice to anyone wanting to develop their skills at being a bystander is to remove all judgement. If people think you are calling them out because you think you're better than them, they'll get defensive and not listen.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>It's a clich&eacute;, I know, but just do it, and keep doing it. Practise being a positive bystander. I don't even notice I'm doing it anymore until people draw my attention to it. Some people don't like you calling them out, but in the end, you know you've done the right thing for the right reasons.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I have had friends say things to me about my behaviour. Sometimes it really hurts, but I appreciate what they said, especially in hindsight. No one was trying to hurt me, but they were trying to tell me I was hurting myself and others. I stopped drinking and got help because of what friends said to me.</p></pod-quote>

									<comic-transcript>
										<p><strong>Joel:</strong> I just got a message. Has anybody heard about Lucy and her female lab supervisor? Apparently they were getting very close over their experiment findings last night. No wonder we haven't seen her today, maybe their 'research' went on a bit late...</p>

Some of the friends look shocked by the confrontation. The male at the end of the table has his hand to his mouth. Suzie looks thoughtful."></comic-image>

										<p><strong>Ed:</strong> Seriously, just shut up man! You always think you have 'the gossip' and it's always rubbish.</p>
										<p><strong>Suzie (thinking):</strong> I'm going to talk to Joel on the way to class when we're alone. He needs to know that sometimes his gossip can hurt people.</p>

									<comic-transcript>
										<p><strong>Amrita:</strong> Be careful, Joel. Even if it's true, you're undermining them both and could be outing them without them knowing or agreeing. I don't want anyone to get hurt.</p>

										<note-feedback>As we just saw with Joel and his friends, bystanders have a number of ways they can intervene positively to improve a situation and stop unwanted, inappropriate or unhealthy behaviours. As mentioned earlier on the screen, they can be loosely categorised as <strong>direct actions </strong> (like Ed and Amrita), <strong>indirect actions</strong> (Pearl), <strong>delayed actions</strong> (Suzie) or <strong>distraction</strong> (Lewis).</note-feedback>

										<p><strong>Sunil (thinking):</strong> I need to talk to Lenny and check he's OK. Amanda seems quite controlling and seems to always pressure him out of things he wants to do. I hope he's happy... </p>

											<p>You'll recognise the <strong>direct</strong>, <strong>indirect</strong>, <strong>delayed</strong> and <strong>distraction</strong> bystander techniques being used in this situation. Which technique would you choose?</p></note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>Friends sometimes think they shouldn't interfere in the conversations and interactions between a couple in their group, but bystanders are often the best placed to see unhealthy behaviour patterns emerging. Amanda and Lenny's friends chose to intervene in a number of ways to help. They can be loosely categorised as <strong>direct actions</strong> (Jack), <strong>indirect actions</strong> (Anna and Lottie),<strong> delayed actions</strong> (Sunil and Claire) or <strong>distraction</strong> (Archie). Two really insightful bystanders here were Anna and Lottie. They indirectly tried to tackle other fears that may have been at the heart of Amanda not wanting to go home on her own. This shows great empathy.</note-feedback>

							<p>As we can see, being a positive bystander isn't about storming in or causing a scene; it can be as simple as making a joke or having a quiet word to a friend. Being a positive bystander can be hard at times, but even small changes in people's behaviour can have big impacts on those around them in the future.</p>

									<p>Approaching someone you think may be in an unhealthy relationship may feel uncomfortable, but it could change someone's life for the better. </p>
									<p>Make sure you have somewhere to talk that allows for tears, or anger, or any emotion they want to feel without fear of embarrassment. Most of all make sure you are taking the time to really listen to what they are saying. You don't need to solve the problem, but being there to listen is something we can all do.</p>
