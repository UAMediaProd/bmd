							<p><strong>Confidence</strong> is feeling certain about something. <strong>Self-esteem</strong> is having confidence in your own worth or ability. <strong>Resilience</strong> is the ability of an individual to cope with and adapt positively to adverse circumstances and new situations.</p>
							<p>None of these concepts are fixed; they can all be learned and developed at any time of life. This module will help you to recognise where your relationship to these concepts could be improved, and give ideas on how to work towards being kinder to yourself.</p>

							<p>When we feel uncertain, it can make us feel that we might not be good enough. Dealing with anything new, like starting at university for the first time or adapting to a new level of study, can increase levels of uncertainty. While this is an uncomfortable feeling, it is normal, and will lessen as you begin to feel more confident of your own abilities.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I felt like an imposter in my first few lectures &ndash; the course is challenging and we were thrown straight into some difficult work. When I spoke to my classmates about how I was feeling, I discovered this was normal, and we were all being challenged by the higher expectations. Understanding that learning something new means getting things wrong at first was so helpful to me.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>It's eye-opening to see the nervousness and self-doubt of the first years I mentor &ndash; I felt exactly the same when I was in their position, and I really felt like I was struggling more than everyone else. I now know that these feelings of uncertainty pass, and the adjustments are all part of the university process. Helping others understand this really helps me to think of this myself whenever I feel a bit overwhelmed.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>Uni started badly for me: my girlfriend ended our relationship as we were at different universities, I wasn't picked for the football team, and my dog died &ndash; all within a few weeks. I felt so low and miserable and didn't think I could stick at uni. But there is so much support available, and I'm so glad my tutor encouraged me to access it. It really helped me in so many ways, particularly in realising that things go wrong but there is always something I can do, especially with help from others.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>One of the biggest challenges to building my confidence, especially in the classroom, was the culture. I come from a culture in which students don't ask many questions and don't talk a lot in the classroom (they just accept what teachers say). It was very difficult for me to start participating in class discussions. Luckily, I have a supportive teacher who understands about the different cultural backgrounds in the classroom. She gave me time and support to help me feel confident to participate in the class.</p></pod-quote>

									<p>Read through each of these scenarios. Which students do you think have low confidence and self-esteem?</p>

										<li>Paz is worried about an exam. He feels very nervous as he walks to the exam room.</li>
										<li>On arrival at her shared accommodation, Letitia excitedly embraces her new housemates.</li>
										<li>Hovering outside her tutor's office, Niamh shuffles from foot to foot as she prepares to knock on the door.</li>

									<p>The answer is: we cannot know from just one snapshot of each student's situation. It is completely normal for anyone to be worried when facing an exam or a deadline, like Paz. Speaking to a tutor or topic coordinator can be nerve-wracking, particularly if it is for the first time, but confidence improves over time. Is Marvin, alone in his room, staying there because he lacks confidence and is avoiding others, or is he having some quiet time because he is confident enough to know that is what he needs? Letitia appears confident, but people often mask their insecurities. So, appearing confident does not necessarily equate to good self-esteem. Letitia will not always feel sociable and at times may need to have some quiet time, like Marvin.</p>
									<p>What is important is that you do not take how you feel in one situation for how you will feel in all situations. For example, Paz is anxious about how he will do in his exam, but this does not necessarily mean that Paz has problematic anxiety.</p>

							<p>As we have already touched on, confidence and self-esteem can be developed. You have been developing them, along with your resilience skills, your whole life. Think about all those times you learned something new, interacted with a new person or entered a new environment for the first time. You probably do not remember that, when you were young, you could not tie your own shoelaces. You were taught and then you practised tying them... plenty of times. Now you are so good at it you do not even think about how you do it. Succeeding in anything takes the same process &ndash; you have to work at it.</p>
