							<p>University can provide exciting opportunities to try new things and develop different parts of your identity. Sometimes the problem can be managing to fit it all in, and working out what's important for both your academic and your personal life. Each student is unique, and finding the right balance for <em>you</em> is important.</p>

									<tab-heading>Overcommitment</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>Overcommitting can leave you feeling unsatisfied and anxious, or simply overtired, as you try to do it all. What's more, we live in bodies that just won't work like machines. Overtiredness will impact both efficiency and enjoyment &ndash; it takes longer to get things done, we do them less well and don't enjoy them as much. Remember to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Prioritise &ndash; keep sight of what's important, and be prepared to let go of things that aren't</li>
											<li>Distinguish between habits and priorities, and don't confuse the two</li>
											<li>Plan and follow through on the plan</li>
											<li>Review both priorities and plans, to make sure they are up to date and working</li>
											<li>Balance &ndash; get the work, play and rest balance right.</li>
										</ul>
									</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Indecisiveness</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>This will happen more when you are not clear about your priorities. This can be for many reasons &ndash; perhaps not knowing yourself well enough yet, feeling pressured from outside to take things on, or being unclear about where you want your life to go. Remember:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>If you keep putting something off; consider whether you really want to do it!</li>
											<li>If you have a tendency to procrastinate, try making a list so you can see your plans written down and check them off for a sense of achievement</li>
											<li>Focus on the next thing that needs doing to meet your goals &ndash; breaking them down into smaller actions helps to get a clearer idea of what you actually have to do. Completing a degree becomes attending the next lecture; playing team football becomes attending the next practice session, etc.</li>
										</ul>
									</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Can't say "no"</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>At university there is no one to monitor your activities except you. Being able to say "no" is a crucial skill. Often called 'being assertive', it doesn't mean ignoring what other people need or want; it means counting what you need and want as equally important. A good start is:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Be honest. "I'm sorry but I just can't help at the moment" is a perfectly OK thing to say. You don't have to justify it</li>
											<lI>Say what you <em>can</em> do as well as what you <em>can't</em>: "I can't do that right now but how about next week?"</lI>
										</ul>
										<p>This means that you are more able to honour the commitments that are truly priorities for you; and that must include being aware of your own wellbeing. The module titled: <em>Your student journey</em> explores the importance of maintaining an awareness of your own priorities.</p>
									</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Pinch points</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>These are the times when deadlines coincide. Consider these students and their conflicting commitments:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><em>It's a month till the summer break and exam period. Mike has four exams in the next four weeks. He is getting invitations to end of semester parties and has also committed to a new job at a local restaurant</em></li>
											<li><em>It's the end of Ramadan. Maalik's family is expecting him home for the Eid celebration, but he has not told them that he has a presentation due on the first day of Eid, and an important athletics match the day after that.</em></li>
										</ul>
										<p>How will Mike and Maalik manage? The real question is, was any of this unforeseeable? The answer is <em>no</em>. Looking ahead and planning for these pinch points would have been the best way of dealing with them. At university, forward planning is crucial, and with it you will accomplish much more, with less stress.</p>
									</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Fitting in paid work</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>Many students need paid work in order to manage their finances. Most universities recommend doing no more than 15 hours per week (and international students may have visa restrictions to consider), and even this might be difficult depending on your year of study. To help manage the tensions between paid work and study, remember:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Employers value reliability and will often be flexible if you can tell them ahead of time when you won't be available</li>
											<li>Increasing your paid hours when there are fewer deadlines can help you manage when you have to pull back in the more pressured times</li>
											<li>Working during the vacation and saving the money can reduce reliance on term-time work.</li>
										</ul>

									<pod-quote>It's been really hard learning to say "no" to things &ndash; I find it hard to let people down, or to deny myself new opportunities. I did it by really stepping back and looking at how satisfied I felt with the balance of my life, and sort of realigning things. I do fewer things now but get a lot of satisfaction from doing them better &ndash; and I'm probably a more relaxed person to be with!</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Marija, 23</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>I generally just drift along; prioritising was a real challenge for me. I sat down with a friend and we went through what I wanted to be doing, and to be like, in three years' time &ndash; and that was really helpful. Then we reversed and I listened to her, which was interesting for me too &ndash; it showed how different we all are, and how we all have to make our own decisions. Now at least I have a way of deciding what's important and what isn't, and we have agreed to do it again in six months and see what's changed.</pod-quote>

Only seeing it as time management might reinforce a feeling that he should be able to manage things if he only tried harder.

									<h4>Feedback</h4>
									<p>Looking at John's commitments, it does seem that he has taken a lot on. It may be challenging for him to consider this, as he is likely to feel that everything is important! There is a great deal of pressure on students to engage in opportunities to enhance their CV in a competitive employment market, and John may feel he has little choice but to take every opportunity. Yet it is impacting his results, which are his priority. He may benefit from sitting down with a careers advisor to get some information about what employers look for so that he can focus on that. A chat with a friend could help him understand his personal priorities while not losing sight of the things that he enjoys. A wellbeing advisor may help him with thinking about how he can look after his mental health in the long run; burnout is a possibility here, especially with the increased workload in his final year. With a more realistic schedule and better planning, he can get back on track.</p>

									<action-question>Jiao is constantly busy. She is popular and a good student so people are often asking her for help. She was encouraged to become an academic peer mentor and course representative, which includes three committee meetings each semester. She joined the International Students Society and has been asked to stand for Chair next year. She joined the Lacrosse Society for fun and has been asked to be Captain. She is managing it all, but instead of feeling happy and productive, she feels increasingly low.</action-question>

									<p>This approach is likely to help Jiao in the long run. Feeling that you have no choice over your life can be very debilitating, but the reality here is that Jiao <em>does</em> have choices but seems to have lost touch with this. It can be hard to say no to opportunities, and as an international student she may be especially sensitive about responding positively to requests made by staff. But the only thing she chose for herself &ndash; joining the Lacrosse Society &ndash; was meant to be for fun yet here she is about to take a leadership role again. Learning that it is OK to make choices and acquiring some assertiveness skills (perhaps from a counsellor) may put Jiao back in the driving seat and allow her to consciously choose her commitments.</p>

									<h4>Feedback</h4>
									<p>While taking a break is a possibility, it is likely to be premature at this stage.

									<h4>Feedback</h4>
									<p>It is only to be expected that things are tougher than Anna or Naomi imagined, and it is natural for them to need to make more, or different, adjustments to those that they anticipated.  Now that they have a clearer understanding of the demands on Anna's time, they are in a good position to make some new plans. For example, Anna can review her time management skills so that she makes the most of the time that she has, and can also check for any perfectionism that leads her towards unrealistic goals. Student services or study skills advisors will be able to help with this, as will the department, who will be used to supporting mature students with family commitments. They may be able to offer more flexibility than she realises.
