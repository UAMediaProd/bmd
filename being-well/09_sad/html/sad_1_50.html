							<p>It might be your mood that is the problem for you. If so, there are several things that you can do to help yourself stay well and avoid it dipping too often. It is better to try to do self-care activities little and often, and get into good habits, rather than try to do everything at once.</p>
							<p>When we feel down it can be really hard to do nice things for ourselves. This is probably the time we need them most. By taking the time to look after our wellbeing and mood daily, we can sometimes prevent things from deteriorating. We can even help to balance out some of the more difficult feelings.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I'd been feeling 'low' and had got into a habit of avoiding social situations. One day in the summer, I opened the window in my room and sat looking at the trees outside. I felt like I wanted to go for a walk, which wasn't a feeling I'd had in a while, so I made myself have a shower, and get dressed (in comfy clothes) and go outside. I felt so much better just being out and part of the world, which is something  I realised I had been avoiding. It was a real step in the right direction.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I started to skip lectures as I found the topic we were working on confusing, and I felt embarrassed about not being able to keep up. However, I soon realised that the avoidance tactics were actually part of the problem &ndash; they had been making my anxious feelings escalate and get worse, rather than helping. Now I know how to use breathing and mindfulness strategies to manage my anxious feelings, instead of avoiding the things that I feel worried about. I spoke to my tutor about my concerns and I've been doing some extra reading to get back up to speed.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>We all sometimes need to remind ourselves to do things to look after our emotional health. By now you should have some ideas about what works for you, and what you might like to try. However, despite our best efforts, sometimes things get difficult and we need to ask for help. There is plenty of help available. You are not alone.</p>
