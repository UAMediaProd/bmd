							<p>Think about everything you have learnt in this module, and take a moment to reflect on your relationship with alcohol.</p>

							<instructional-text>
								<p>Make a list of the ways you could mitigate the risks associated with drinking alcohol. If you don't drink, you may choose to make a list of ways to help someone you know develop a healthier relationship with alcohol. We have given you some examples &ndash; if they are not relevant to you, you can delete them by clicking on the cross. Then write your first point and click on the 'Plus' symbol to reveal the next space. You can include up to six points. If you want to stop before you reach six, just click 'Plus' to make sure your last entry is recorded.</p>

							<p>You may only want to change a few things, or you may feel there's a lot to work on. Feel free to come back and update the checklist again at a different point in your student journey, or if you feel your relationship with alcohol may have shifted. We hope it helps to improve your wellbeing.</p>
