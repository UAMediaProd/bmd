								  <node-heading>Unhealthy relationships</node-heading>
								  <node-content>
									<p>Unhealthy relationships can often be identified by broad categories of behaviour. Under each category are some typical things people might do in unhealthy relationships. Recognising these makes it easier for all of us to identify when friendships or intimate relationships might be unhealthy. These characteristics can exist both in person and online. There can be increased vulnerability and different forms of unhealthy behaviour when people are from LGBT+ communities, live with a disability or come from very strict religious or cultural backgrounds.</p>

								</central-concept>
								<concept-nodes>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Coercion and manipulation </node-heading>
									<node-content>
									  <p>This is when someone puts pressure on you, makes you feel guilty or deceives you to get what they want. It may be seen through behavioural examples such as:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Placing conditions on receiving their love and friendship</li>
											<li>Making people feel guilty if you don't want the same things they do</li>
											<li>Questioning motives for doing things</li>
											<li>Gaslighting: dismissing or denying the way someone remembers something. This can often be accompanied by suggesting the person being gaslit has some form of mental illness or is overly dramatic, lying or delusional in some way.</li>
										</ul>
									</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Bullying and control</node-heading>
									<node-content>
									  <p>Bullying and seeking control are patterns of behaviour, repeated either intentionally or unintentionally, that give a person power (e.g. physical, emotional, academic, professional, financial) over another. Example behaviours include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Isolating from friends/family/social/academic/cultural/religious activities</li>
											<li>Preventing taking of medications, using disability aids or accessing medical or support services</li>
											<li>Making all the decisions, or mocking or undermining others' decisions</li>
											<li>Putting down in public and/or private (and leading to low self-esteem in victims)</li>
											<li>Giving the silent treatment or denying communication/access, especially when there are things like shared bank accounts or academic assignments or research.</li>
										</ul>
									</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Peer pressure </node-heading>
									<node-content>
									  <p>Peer pressure (group harassment or bullying) is an unhealthy dynamic where a group exerts pressure over individuals to participate in activities, situations or conversations they do not freely want to be involved in. It can be particularly damaging or toxic when there are significant power differences between members. Forms of peer pressure often encountered by students are:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Initiation ceremonies or rituals for colleges, clubs and societies that involve students being forced to do humiliating, dangerous or even illegal things to become members</li>
											<li>Pressure to binge drink, take drugs, be sexually active or drive in dangerous ways</li>
											<li>Drinking games or risk-taking games like Truth or Dare. Games such as these often involve escalating risky behaviours that place mounting pressure on participants</li>
											<li>Hazing rituals, rules or songs directed at new students</li>
											<li>Pressure to post compromising photos on personal feeds or group chats.</li>
										</ul>
									</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Unhappy or unfulfilling</node-heading>
									<node-content>
									  <p>At some point, you may realise that a friend or partner no longer brings joy into your life. There may be nothing in common anymore or spending time together is no longer fun. It may be nothing destructive, but the absence of good things is also unhealthy. A relationship may seem unhappy or unfulfilling if:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Spending time together is out of obligation rather than want</li>
											<li>Thinking about seeing that person or spending time with them sparks dread, nervousness or disappointment</li>
											<li>Actually spending time with them causes flatness, feeling drained or reduces happiness.</li>
										</ul>	
									</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Jealousy or insecurity</node-heading>
									<node-content>
									  <p>We all feel unsure or envious at times and singular feelings, like with <strong>bullying and control</strong>, are not always signs of unhealthy relationships. But, if friends or partners consistently default to positions of insecurity or jealousy, sometimes bordering on paranoia, this is an unhealthy relationship dynamic. It can be seen in behaviours such as:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Checking where you have been or who you have been with as a matter of importance or urgency to them (not out of interest in you). This can have an edge of interrogation or need to prove you are telling the truth</li>
											<li>Messaging you to ask about what you are doing repeatedly</li>
											<lI>Questioning you about social media posts</lI>
											<li>Expecting you home/in class/at work until or by certain times, and needing answers to account for your time.</li>
										</ul>
									</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Fear and intimidation</node-heading>
									<node-content>
									  <p>Controlling a friend or partner through fear or intimidation is very destructive and can erode self-confidence and self-esteem for years after a relationship ends. Some behaviours that indicate that fear and intimidation are being used within a relationship are:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Stalking &ndash; either physical and/or online. Stalking involves being followed, knowingly or not, to see where you are, what you are doing, who you are talking to, etc. Stalking can also be achieved by asking other people about the person; friends, family, classmates or work colleagues can sometimes unwittingly help the stalker by providing information. Always be aware when someone is asking for information about a friend or a family member, and don't hesitate to ask them why they want to know. For more information on online stalking, see the module titled: <em>Online safety</em></li>
											<li>Always blaming you for things that go wrong (a good way to spot this is when it is things that are outside anyone's control, such as the weather or late public transport)</li>
											<li>Getting very upset over small things &ndash; as this creates great fear over what happens if something big goes wrong</li>
											<li>Threats to share or actually sharing secrets or intimate knowledge. This may include nude pictures or private messages. This could also be threats to out someone for their sexuality or tell others about an intellectual or physical disability or impairment</li>
											<li>Threats to harm themselves if you don't do what they ask.</li>
										</ul>
									</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Violence and abuse</node-heading>
									<node-content>
									  <p>Violence is never acceptable, and this includes physical, emotional and verbal abuse. Examples of violence and abuse may include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Actual physical harm (or threats of harm) such as hitting, hair-pulling, strangling, or sexual assault</li>
											<li>Throwing objects or damaging property or possessions</li>
											<li>Verbal abuse such as name-calling or public humiliation</li>
											<li>Denying or preventing access to help for medical conditions, academic assistance or spiritual guidance. This might be something as simple (but destructive) as deliberately hiding your keys and wallet, or taking away your travel card so you can't use it</li>
											<li>Stopping a same-sex partner from contacting children whom they have raised together, as they have no legal rights.</li>
										</ul>

									<pod-quote><p>My friend said she didn't like a guy, so I asked him out. This was the day before we were going on a holiday together. She said she was fine with it, but this clearly wasn't the case. She was 'off' from the moment I got into the car, and we had to drive in silence except for when she decided the music was allowed to be on. When I was driving I asked her for directions but she ignored me. When we got lost, she exploded and screamed at me that I was useless because I had taken us the wrong way. She was so angry I was actually scared of her.</p>
									<p>We had been friends since kindergarten and I had never really seen that side of her, but I knew she could be mean about other people. I thought she was going to hit me. I couldn't talk to her anymore. It was like I didn't even know her.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>At some point I had to just say: "Enough. I don't owe you my friendship. I don't like who you want me to be when I'm with you. We need to change it up or I'd rather be around other friends."</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Jimmy, 26</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>Every time I tried to go out with a group of friends from football, my best friend would suddenly need me. It would be some big issue or thing that demanded my presence. I'd cancel, turn up, and then it would be no big deal. When I complained I got told it was me being dramatic for cancelling and that I was imagining an emergency for the drama of it. I wasn't, it was just their way of controlling me and stopping me making other friends.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I think violent relationships are more common than we realise. We are all still learning about who we are and that can make us vulnerable to being abused as well as being abusive. We need to find better ways of being. Friends and lovers should be the people you turn to for support, not the ones that hurt you.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I have a friend who was in a dominant/submissive relationship (she's the sub). What they did sexually in that agreement was fine, but he would degrade her over text and in public. It seemed like a warped kind of power play that she hadn't agreed to, and it really hurt her. The guy didn't respect her or what they'd communicated about, and the boundaries they'd set.</p></pod-quote>

										<h4>Feedback</h4>
										<p>You can see from the 'Need more information' category, that one incident out of context is often not enough to assess a relationship. Healthy relationships are based on a pattern of positive behaviours that empower and nourish participants, whereas unhealthy relationships are characterised by behaviours that consistently or repetitively diminish or harm at least one participant. For example, if you are being teased in a group chat for the first time ever, then this may just be part of the dynamics of a healthy friendship group. But if there is a pattern of the joke always being on one person, and that person feels uncomfortable or disempowered, then it is bullying, which is unhealthy for all involved.</p>
