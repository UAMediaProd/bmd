							<p>Smart drugs (also known as nootropics or cognitive enhancers) are substances consumed to increase the length of concentration, heighten performance and increase wakefulness. Most smart drugs are stimulants. You are probably very familiar with one drug that falls into this category: caffeine! Caffeine is the substance in coffee that increases wakefulness and energy levels.</p>

							<p>Very little is known about how effective these smart drugs actually are. Some smart drugs seem to improve memory, but researchers still don't agree about the enhancement of other cognitive abilities. In fact, some scientists claim that these drugs actually limit our problem-solving potential and creativity.</p>
							<p>Let's consider why students may want to take smart drugs, and the possible negative consequences these habits could have in the short- and long-term.</p>

											</reflection-hint>
											<reflection-feedback>
												<p class="middle">Modafinil is a relatively safe stimulant. However, it may have some short- and long-term negative consequences. If Christine is taking modafinil to push her body and mind too far, she might miss when her body is telling her to rest. This may lead to higher risks of injuries and of mental burnouts. Modafinil increases blood pressure and heart rate, and is not recommended for people with cardiovascular problems. It can also cause complications for people with liver problems, and long-term sustained use may cause dependence and anxiety. Modafinil also reduces the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives such as the pill (condoms and IUDs are the only forms of birth control not affected by modafinil). Finally, the use of modafinil is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, so Christine would fail a drugs test if she played sport professionally. She should also consider the ethics of using drugs to enhance her performance.</p>

											<reflection-hint>
												<p class="center middle">Think about the physical effects of drinking a lot of caffeine and how
													this
													may influence her mood.</p>
											</reflection-hint>
											<reflection-feedback>
												<p class="middle">Caffeine is contained in coffee, tea, chocolate and drinks such as
													Coca-Cola. Consuming too much caffeine (more than four cups of strong coffee a day) may lead to irritability, dehydration, sleep problems and stomach pains. Feeling constantly fatigued can also heighten anxiety or depression symptoms. Moreover, regular, heavy use of coffee can lead to poor appetite, nausea, diarrhoea and cardiovascular changes, such as low blood pressure. The body and mind get used to functioning with coffee, so giving up coffee results in withdrawal symptoms. These could include headaches, irritability, difficulty concentrating, flu-like symptoms and/or depressed mood. It is recommended that no caffeine is consumed after 2pm to prevent an impact on sleep cycles.</p>

Ritalin and amphetamine drugs show a high potential for abuse and dependence, so it is important to take regular and sufficiently long breaks. Nahida could consider talking to her tutor about how much pressure she feels she is under, as they will be able to advise her on where to seek help and give her some tips on good study habits. Effective study habits are explored in detail in the module titled: <em>Studying well</em>.</p>

Research suggests that it is relatively safe, but some case studies suggest that negative side-effects of daily use of piracetam include depression, agitation, tiredness, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, headaches, nausea, paranoia, and diarrhoea. As with any drug, the recommendation is to take breaks and not to consume more than the specified dose.</p>

											</reflection-hint>
											<reflection-feedback>
												<p class="middle">Anabolic steroids are usually compounds that are synthetically modified from the hormone testosterone. They are consumed to enhance muscle volume and athletic performance. Athletes, weightlifters and bodybuilders might take them successfully and regularly to boost their performance. However, they have a very strict and medically controlled schedule, which still results in negative
												and long-term consequences. Taking steroids regularly has negative physical effects such as hair loss, stomach pain and sexual dysfunctions. The effects differ among men and women. These drugs can also have devastating effects on the cardiovascular and digestive systems. Steroids can also impact negatively on your mental health. Not only do they create dependence, which can result in depression, anxiety and insomnia when giving them up, but they also increase aggression, emotional volatility and manic behaviour.</p>

							<p>Improving in anything takes time and commitment, and to achieve a desired performance in sports or studying you will often need to take small and incremental steps. Some substances claim to help you make a leap in your results, but clear evidence is still lacking, and they may have serious side-effects.</p>
							<p>However tempting it is to take shortcuts, try to think of the impact that forming these habits may have on your future self, and how that might be detrimental to what you are trying to achieve with short-term strategies. Remember that using substances may be considered cheating in some competitions, which could put you at risk of losing everything you are striving so hard to achieve.</p>
