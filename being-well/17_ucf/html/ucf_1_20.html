							<p>Although your tuition fees cover your teaching and university facilities, there will be other study-related costs you will need to budget for. As well as general things like textbooks, stationery and printing, you will need to think about any placements that form part of your course. Try to plan ahead and put aside money now if you are able, to help with these upcoming costs.</p>

									<p>You might be surprised by how many resources you can access through the library. Libraries offer access to thousands of journals and e-books, can sometimes buy copies of books you request, and may even have laptops you can borrow by the hour to work on.</p>
									<p>Some students' associations and university support services also have staff who can give you advice on managing your finances and study costs.</p>

							<p>It is important to be aware of any additional costs that might come up during your course early on, so you can plan for them. Consider talking to students in the years above you to see if they had similar worries, and what they did to resolve them. Don't forget that your student services or your students' association will also have helped lots of students with very similar concerns, so they are bound to have some advice for you.</p>
