									<p>If you have a friend who shares their difficulties with you, don't feel you need to
										have all the answers to 'fix' the problem. Just listening and showing that you
										accept how they are feeling can be a lot more helpful than giving your opinion or
										trying to advise them.</p>
									<p>While people's social media posts tend to focus on sharing their 'best life', it can
										also be a huge comfort when friends are honest about their own struggles, and don't

									<p>Grace got the ATAR results she was predicted and a place at her first choice of university. She was popular at school, and feels confident and excited about university. Grace comes from a regional town and has moved interstate for university. She is living out of home for the first time, sharing private accommodation with other students. She is completely unprepared when she experiences strong pangs of homesickness during her first few weeks at university.</p>
									<action-link goto-panel="2">
										<p><strong>Parents:</strong> We don't know what to say to Grace when she phones home in floods of tears,
										saying she wants to come home for the weekend. It's not like her at all. We just try
										to remind her how excited she was, and tell her not to be so silly when she says no
										one likes her. So far we've managed to persuade her to stay there on weekends &ndash;
										running back home isn't going to help her get to know people and settle in.</p>
									</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="3">
										<p><strong>Friends from home:</strong> From the pictures she'd posted on social media we thought Grace was having a fantastic time at university. Then she sent a drunken message to our old Year 12 group chat saying worrying things like: "What's the point?" but she deleted it the next morning so we didn't want to embarrass her by bringing it up. We're all going to go back home in a few weeks and we've organised a big party. Hopefully that will cheer her up.</p>
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 1 -->
								<action-panel panel="2" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Homesickness isn't 'silly' &ndash; it's a natural emotion that many people experience. The powerful combination of anxiety and sadness is triggered as a signal that we are lacking the familiar surroundings and close, bonded relationships which are essential to our long-term safety. So it's almost inevitable to experience some level of homesickness when starting in a completely new and unfamiliar environment.</p>
									<p>Grace could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Let her parents know that they can help by acknowledging rather than dismissing her feelings</li>
										<li>Organise visits during university breaks to give herself the rest and connection she needs whilst she is still finding her feet at university</li>
										<li>Join in as much as possible with O-Week activities, but focus on activities she enjoys to give herself the best chance of meeting like-minded people to make friends with.</li>
									</ul>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 2 -->
								<action-panel panel="3" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>It is understandable to want our social media posts to give the impression of a confident, popular image. But staying properly in touch with old friends &ndash; with everyone sharing the ups and downs of their new challenges &ndash; can be a really valuable source of support while you are finding your feet at university.</p>
									<p>Grace's friends could help by:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Expressing their concern about her post and encouraging her to talk honestly about how she is feeling</li>
										<li>Not assuming what would cheer her up, but asking her what would help most</li>
										<li>Sharing their own struggles and difficulties in adjusting to new environments, where relevant.</li>

									<p>Leon made a late decision to take up a place through an Indigenous entry pathway to study teaching at a local university. He is the first in his family to go to university. Commuting from home allowed him to maintain local friendships, but he has recently fallen out with his friends. Although he has found the course interesting, he is finding the second year harder. He is discouraged that his textbooks still use colonial examples and has started feeling less motivated, wondering if he should continue.</p>
									<action-link goto-panel="5">
										<p><strong>Friends from home:</strong> Leon has changed. Last year, even though he was the only one going to university, he still hung out with us all the time. But now he keeps blowing us off and saying he has to study or he doesn't have any money. He probably thinks he's too good for us now, but he should be more connected with his community.</p>
									</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="6">
										<p><strong>Nan:</strong> We don't really know what to advise Leon. It's good for him to have the Centrelink support coming in, to contribute to the bills, but we worry about the HECS-HELP debt he is getting into. Maybe university isn't the right thing for him &ndash; he might not even manage
										to get a degree. My nephew is a plumber and is looking for an apprentice and I think he might be better off doing that. </p>
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 3 -->
								<action-panel panel="5" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Keeping up existing friendships can provide a good support base for tackling new challenges, but a university course is a transforming experience, and it can be difficult for our friends and family to adjust to the changes they see in us. It can also be difficult to navigate our changing feelings and perspectives within existing relationships.</p>
									<p>Leon could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Organise time to spend with his friends and family to remain grounded with his community</li>
										<li>Try reassuring his friends that he still needs and values their company</li>
										<li>Explain the increasing demands of his course to them, so they are more flexible in accommodating the different demands on his time and attention</li>
										<li>Follow up on opportunities to get to know students on his course in order to make some new friends.</li>
									</ul>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 4 -->
								<action-panel panel="6" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>It can be particularly difficult facing a new challenge without the benefit of family or friends with the relevant experience to offer advice and guidance. Traveling over an hour each day to get to university, it can also be harder getting to know people and feeling engaged with the course and with university.</p>
									<p>Before making a decision to discontinue, Leon could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Connect with the university's Indigenous Centre and staff to see what support, activities and events can help him engage with different peers</li>
										<li>Find out what services or support are offered by his university and students' association to students who travel each day, such as dedicated study spaces and parking support on campus or networks for connecting with students in similar situations</li>
										<li>Speak to his academic advisors and/or get study skills tutors, to get help with adjusting to the greater demands in the second year</li>
										<li>Make sure he uses resources like the careers and employability service or finance advice to consider all his options. For example, it might be possible for him to apply for scholarships or a work integrated learning programme, which would allow him to gain teaching or mentoring experience while studying.</li>

									<p>Lin knows that doing a postgraduate degree in Australia will give her a much better chance of getting a good job when she returns to China, but she is miserable. She was one of the top students in English language studies at her school in China, but now that she is studying in English she is finding it difficult to follow the lectures and she is too self-conscious to talk to the English-speaking students in her class. </p>
									<action-link goto-panel="8">
										<p><strong>Mother:</strong> I keep telling Lin not to spend so much time with her friends from the
										Chinese Society. How will her English ever improve if she doesn't make Australian friends? She needs to speak English all the time so that she has the best skills
										when she returns. </p>
									</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="9">
										<p><strong>Friends in the Chinese Society:</strong> Lin is better off sticking with us. We look out for each other and the second-year Master's Chinese students pass on work and essays to help the new students. The Australian students don't make the effort to mix with us in class anyway, so there is no point trying to practise English with them.</p>
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 5 -->
								<action-panel panel="8" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Studying and navigating daily life in a second or third language is a highly challenging task, taking an enormous amount of mental and emotional energy. Opportunities to speak your first language can give some vital rest from the 'culture shock' of all the unfamiliarity you may be negotiating.</p>
									<p>Lin could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Use the Chinese Society as a good home base</li>
										<li>Continue to explore other ways to make new international friends and practise her language skills</li>
										<li>Find out if her university has pre/mid-semester or concurrent language courses to help students meet English language skill levels and/or build confidence in discipline-specific or academic language skills.</li>
									</ul>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 6 -->
								<action-panel panel="9" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Postgraduate study can be isolating and challenging in itself, and studying or researching in a second or third language adds a significant level of difficulty to the task. At all levels of university study, it is a good idea to form study clubs and make use of peer support, which can be an excellent learning resource.  However, all students should make sure that they understand the rules about academic integrity and that all their submissions for assessment are their own work.</p>
									<p>Lin could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Continue to use peer support from her Chinese Society friends to develop her own independent understanding and learning</li>
										<li>Challenge herself to make use of group work and other opportunities in class to develop connections with other students</li>
										<li>Explore other clubs and interest groups to expand her circle of friends.</li>

									<p>Simon grew up in out-of-home care and had a difficult start in life, but has taken up an alternate entry programme after suffering an injury at work. He feels passionate about studying to become a social worker to help other young people like him in the future, and is impatient with the other students on his course who he perceives as immature and not serious about studying. He has recently gotten into conflict with his housemates over late night noise.</p>
									<action-link goto-panel="11">
										<p><strong>Housemates:</strong> Simon needs to lighten up. He should stop isolating himself in his room and come out with us more, but we've given up inviting him out because he just studies all the time. He was rude when he shouted at Katie about playing her music when we came back home late, and ruined the whole night. He should move out if he can't take a bit of noise.</p>
									</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="12">
										<p><strong>Student support advisor:</strong> Simon talked with me about a situation regarding his behaviour towards one of his housemates. I advised him that living in a shared house is often difficult and it's essential that everyone communicates their needs clearly. They should agree on shared rules about noise and, in the future, if there are issues that can't be resolved, he can call one of us instead of becoming aggressive. He needs to calm down and be a bit more realistic about how quiet he can expect it to be when sharing accommodation with others.</p>
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 7 -->
								<action-panel panel="11" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Living in shared accommodation can be a great source of friendship and fun, and an opportunity to get to know a wide range of people from differing backgrounds &ndash; but this does also come with challenges. You will almost certainly need to develop skills for expressing and accommodating a range of needs and preferences. Simon's housemates may not be taking into account factors like financial constraints, which might impact his choices. </p>
									<p>Simon could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Consider sharing his needs and preferences with his housemates in a more constructive way </li>
										<li>See if his university has information or frameworks for students engaging in rental accommodation (see the screen titled: <em>Forming communities</em> for more information)</li>
										<li>Investigate student clubs and societies with an academic focus, or opportunities to volunteer with local young people as a way to find more like-minded peers.</li>
									</ul>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 8 -->
								<action-panel panel="12" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Household agreements can help to set expectations at the beginning stages of renting. Things like noise should be discussed for everyone's benefit and there should be backup ideas if things don't go to plan. Many universities offer rental advice to students, as well as support for dealing with complaints and moving if things become too difficult in their current living arrangements.</p>
									<p>Simon could explore other university support options such as:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Proactive support for him and his housemates to develop inclusive and respectful relationships, such as existing or facilitated housemate agreements</li>
										<li>Mediation or conflict resolution services to help students resolve common disputes, in shared accommodation or group work, for example</li>
										<li>Specific support for students from out-of-home care, or those who are estranged from or lacking family support, which could include additional financial or priority access to suitable accommodation and specialist mentoring.</li>

									<p> Heather is a single parent and a highly motivated student who got the top mark in
										her class at the end of the first year. She is meticulous about attending all her
										timetabled classes and making extensive notes afterwards, often staying up late at
										night to fit in her studies alongside her busy part-time job and caring for her two
										young children. She missed the first lecture of an important module at the start of
										her second year, due to a child being ill, and has now started getting highly
										anxious before every class.</p>
									<action-link goto-panel="14">
										<p><strong>Class tutor:</strong> I've told Heather she has nothing to feel anxious about. She is a
										very capable student and is achieving very well. We do have a full attendance
										policy, but of course exceptional circumstances can be accommodated. I don't have
										time to go over the whole topic with her myself, but I am sure she will easily catch
										up on what she has missed by looking up the topic in the set texts on the reading
										list. </p>
									</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="15">
										<p><strong>Fellow students:</strong> We voted Heather as course rep because she always seems to know what
										is going on and she takes really good notes. She has been looking really stressed
										out lately, but when we ask her about it she just says she's fine and we don't want
										to annoy her by asking again. We are all quite stressed because we know that our
										assessments this year are going to start counting towards our final grade. </p>
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 9 -->
								<action-panel panel="14" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Despite seeming to have earned good results, these study habits do not sound sustainable. Perfectionist overwork like this can result from anxiety about failure, and can ironically lead to increased anxiety when the approach inevitably becomes unsustainable. For more information on perfectionism, see the module titled: <em>Am I good enough?</em></p>
									<p>Heather could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Recognise that even high-achieving students like her can benefit from additional support to develop more effective study skills</li>
										<li>Ask her class tutor for a proper appointment to explain in more detail how she has been feeling and ask about further support</li>
										<li>Approach the welfare services to request counselling for anxiety and/or attend workshops to learn skills for managing anxiety and perfectionism.</li>
									</ul>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 10 -->
								<action-panel panel="15" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Fellow students are often the ones to notice when someone is not themselves. However, it might be difficult for a student like Heather, who is used to being the one offering support to others, to acknowledge their own need for support &ndash; so it is worth classmates using the 'ask twice' rule. This is when you follow up and ask again if someone initially says they are feeling OK.</p>
									<p>Heather could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Recognise that she has a lot going on and is setting very high expectations for herself</li>
										<li>Learn about the risks of perfectionism (see the module titled: <em>Am I good enough?</em>)</li>
										<li>Practise more self-care and self-compassion, as well as allowing herself to take up the offer of support from fellow students</li>
										<li>Look to meet other students with similar circumstances, to hear how others can also struggle with juggling their commitments and to obtain mutual support.</li>

									<p> Hari couldn't wait to start a new life at a university, free from the rules and restrictions imposed by his conservative family. In his second year, he joined the LGBT+ Society, and has loved being connected to a community in which he feels supported. However, he is now procrastinating with his revision and is very stressed about trying to find a job before he finishes university. He is desperate not to have to move back home.</p>
									<action-link goto-panel="17">
										<p><strong>Parents:</strong> We had wanted Hari to study Law and we are regretting allowing him to switch to Film Studies where there isn't a clear career path after graduation. For now he just needs to focus on making sure that he gets very good results, then when he comes home he can start looking for a job. We are expecting him to come back home for a few years, so he can save up and then get married and settle down. </p>
									</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="18">
										<p><strong>LGBT+ Society friends:</strong> We are worried about Hari. He says his parents will disown him if he comes out to them as gay, but it would be too hard for him to go back to hiding his identity. He isn't doing nearly enough work for his final exams, and he might even be in danger of failing the year &ndash; which is a bad way to put off finishing his degree! If he pushes himself now he can still do well, and then he should persuade his parents that he needs to do a Master's degree so he can stay on.</p>
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<!-- feedback 11 -->
								<action-panel panel="17" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>Many students and their families face difficult adjustments to new statuses and identities when they return to the family home as graduates. It may not always be possible to have open conversations to address these challenges. Managing conflicting expectations can be more difficult when graduates are going to remain financially dependent on their parents.</p>
									<p>Hari could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Recognise the significant psychological pressure he is under, due to the strong contrast between his parents' expectations and the identity he has been developing while at university</li>
										<li>Make full use of the free professional counselling usually available at university</li>
										<li>Talk things through with other neutral third parties, to consider his options more carefully</li>
										<li>Find a way to put aside any big decisions or plans until after his exams.</li>
									</ul>

								<!-- feedback 12 -->
								<action-panel panel="18" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Our advice</h4>
									<p>University study is often a personally transforming experience. The final year at university can often bring difficult inner conflicts to a head, putting extra pressure on students just when they most need to focus on their finals. It is a good idea to make use of the free professional counselling usually available at university to address identity issues as they arise, giving more time to work out how to manage them.</p>
									<p>Hari could:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Avoid making hurried job applications while he is under pressure to prepare for his final assessments</li>
										<li>Get advice and support from academic staff to consider realistic options, e.g. whether a Master's would be a viable option</li>
										<li>Discuss this and his general job prospects with careers and employability advisors so that he can weigh his options with all the available information</li>
										<li>Make use of professional support to manage the pressure safely.</li>

								<p>Leon made a late decision to take up a place through an Indigenous entry pathway to study teaching at a local university. He is the first in his family to go to university. Commuting from home allowed him to maintain local friendships, but he has recently fallen out with his friends. Although he has found the course interesting, he is finding the second year harder. He is discouraged that his textbooks still use colonial examples and has started feeling less motivated, wondering if he should continue.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Friends from home:</strong> Leon has changed. Last year, even though he was the only one going to university, he still hung out with us all the time. But now he keeps blowing us off and saying he has to study or he doesn't have any money. He probably thinks he's too good for us now, but he should be more connected with his community.</li>
									<li><strong>Nan:</strong> We don't really know what to advise Leon. It's good for him to have the Centrelink support coming in, to contribute to the bills, but we worry about the HECS-HELP debt he is getting into. Maybe university isn't the right thing for him &ndash; he might not even manage to get a degree. My nephew is a plumber and is looking for an apprentice and I think he might be better off doing that.</li>
								</ul>

								<br>If you recommended the feedback from Leon's Dad, continue to <strong>Feedback 4</strong>.</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 3:</h4>
								<p>Keeping up existing friendships can provide a good support base for tackling new challenges, but a university course is a transforming experience, and it can be difficult for our friends and family to adjust to the changes they see in us. It can also be difficult to navigate our changing feelings and perspectives within existing relationships.</p>
								<p>Leon could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Organise time to spend with his friends and family to remain grounded with his community</li>
									<li>Try reassuring his friends that he still needs and values their company</li>
									<li>Explain the increasing demands of his course to them, so they are more flexible in accommodating the different demands on his time and attention</li>
									<li>Follow up on opportunities to get to know students on his course in order to make some new friends.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 4:</h4>
								<p>It can be particularly difficult facing a new challenge without the benefit of family or friends with the relevant experience to offer advice and guidance. Traveling over an hour each day to get to university, it can also be harder getting to know people and feeling engaged with the course and with university.</p>
								<p>Before making a decision to discontinue, Leon could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Connect with the university's Indigenous Centre and staff to see what support, activities and events can help him engage with different peers</li>
									<li>Find out what services or support are offered by his university and students' association to students who travel each day, such as dedicated study spaces and parking support on campus or networks for connecting with students in similar situations</li>
									<li>Speak to his academic advisors and/or get study skills tutors, to get help with adjusting to the greater demands in the second year</li>
									<li>Make sure he uses resources like the careers and employability service or finance advice to consider all his options. For example, it might be possible for apply for scholarships or a work integrated learning programme, which would allow him to gain teaching or mentoring experience while studying.</li>

								<h4>Scenario 3: Lin is a postgraduate student lacking confidence in her level of English.</h4>
								<p>Lin knows that doing a postgraduate degree in Australia will give her a much better chance of getting a good job when she returns to China, but she is miserable. She was one of the top students in English language studies at her school in China, but now that she is studying in English she is finding it difficult to follow the lectures and she is too self-conscious to talk to the English-speaking students in her class.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Mother:</strong> I keep telling Lin not to spend so much time with her friends from the Chinese Society. How will her English ever improve if she doesn't make Australian friends? She needs to speak English all the time so that she has the best skills when she returns.</li>
									<li><strong>Friends in the Chinese Society:</strong> Lin is better off sticking with us. We look out for each other and the second-year Master's Chinese students pass on work and essays to help the new students. The Australian students don't make the effort to mix with us in class anyway, so there is no point trying to practise English with them.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you recommended the advice from Lin's Mother, continue to <strong>Feedback 5</strong>.
								<br>If you recommended the feedback from Lin's friends in the Chinese Society, continue to <strong>Feedback 6</strong>.</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 5:</h4>
								<p>Studying and navigating daily life in a second or third language is a highly challenging task, taking an enormous amount of mental and emotional energy. Opportunities to speak your first language can give some vital rest from the 'culture shock' of all the unfamiliarity you may be negotiating.</p>
								<p>Lin could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Use the Chinese Society as a good home base</li>
									<li>Continue to explore other ways to make new international friends and practise her language skills</li>
									<li>Find out if her university has pre/mid-semester or concurrent language courses to help students meet English language skill levels and/or build confidence in discipline-specific or academic language skills.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 6:</h4>
								<p>Postgraduate study can be isolating and challenging in itself, and studying or researching in a second or third language adds a significant level of difficulty to the task. At all levels of university study, it is a good idea to form study clubs and make use of peer support, which can be an excellent learning resource. However, all students should make sure that they understand the rules about academic integrity and that all their submissions for assessment are their own work.</p>
								<p>Lin could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Continue to use peer support from her Chinese Society friends to develop her own independent understanding and learning</li>
									<li>Challenge herself to make use of group work and other opportunities in class to develop connections with other students</li>
									<li>Explore other clubs and interest groups to expand her circle of friends.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Scenario 4: Simon is experiencing conflict with his housemates.</h4>
								<p>Simon grew up in out-of-home care and had a difficult start in life, but has taken up an alternate entry programme after suffering an injury at work. He feels passionate about studying to become a social worker to help other young people like him in the future, and is impatient with the other students on his course who he perceives as immature and not serious about studying. He has recently gotten into conflict with his housemates over late night noise.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Housemates:</strong> Simon needs to lighten up. He should stop isolating himself in his room and come out with us more, but we've given up inviting him out because he just studies all the time. He was rude when he shouted at Katie about playing her music when we came back home late, and ruined the whole night. He should move out if he can't take a bit of noise.</li>
									<li><strong>Student support advisor:</strong> Simon talked with me about a situation regarding his behaviour towards one of his housemates. I advised him that living in a shared house is often difficult and it's essential that everyone communicates their needs clearly. They should agree on shared rules about noise and, in the future, if there are issues that can't be resolved, he can call one of us instead of becoming aggressive. He needs to calm down and be a bit more realistic about how quiet he can expect it to be when sharing accommodation with others.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you recommended the advice from Simon's housemates, continue to <strong>Feedback 7</strong>.
								<br>If you recommended the feedback from Simon's Student Support Advisor, continue to <strong>Feedback 8</strong>.</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 7:</h4>
								<p>Living in shared accommodation can be a great source of friendship and fun, and an opportunity to get to know a wide range of people from differing backgrounds &ndash; but this does also come with challenges. You will almost certainly need to develop skills for expressing and accommodating a range of needs and preferences. Simon's housemates may not be taking into account factors like financial constraints, which might impact his choices.</p>
								<p>Simon could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Consider sharing his needs and preferences with his housemates in a more constructive way</li>
									<li>See if his university has information or frameworks for students engaging in rental accommodation (see the screen titled: <em>Forming communities</em> for more information)</li>
									<li>Investigate student clubs and societies with an academic focus, or opportunities to volunteer with local young people as a way to find more like-minded peers.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 8:</h4>
								<p>Household agreements can help to set expectations at the beginning stages of renting. Things like noise should be discussed for everyone's benefit and there should be backup ideas if things don't go to plan. Many universities offer rental advice to students, as well as support for dealing with complaints and moving things become too difficult in their current living arrangements.</p>
								<p>Simon could explore other university support options such as:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Proactive support for him and his housemates to develop inclusive and respectful relationships, such as existing or facilitated housemate agreements</li>
									<li>Mediation or conflict resolution services to help students resolve common disputes, in shared accommodation or group work for, example</li>
									<li>Specific support for students from out-of-home care, or those who are estranged from or lacking family support, which could include additional financial or priority access to suitable accommodation and specialist mentoring.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Scenario 5: Heather feels anxious about missing an important lecture and falling behind.</h4>
								<p>Heather is a single parent and a highly motivated student who got the top mark in her class at the end of the first year. She is meticulous about attending all her timetabled classes and making extensive notes afterwards, often staying up late at night to fit in her studies alongside her busy part-time job and caring for her two young children. She missed the first lecture of an important module at the start of her second year, due to a child being ill, and has now started getting highly anxious before every class.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Class tutor:</strong> I've told Heather she has nothing to feel anxious about. She is a very capable student and is achieving very well. We do have a full attendance policy, but of course exceptional circumstances can be accommodated. I don't have time to go over the whole topic with her myself, but I am sure she will easily catch up on what she has missed by looking up the topic in the set texts on the reading list.</li>
									<li><strong>Fellow students:</strong> We voted Heather as course rep because she always seems to know what is going on and she takes really good notes. She has been looking really stressed out lately, but when we ask her about it she just says she's fine and we don't want to annoy her by asking again. We are all quite stressed because we know that our assessments this year are going to start counting towards our final grade.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you recommended the advice from Heather's Personal Tutor, continue to <strong>Feedback 9</strong>.
								<br>If you recommended the feedback from Heather's fellow students, continue to <strong>Feedback 10</strong>.</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 9:</h4>
								<p>Despite seeming to have earned good results, these study habits do not sound sustainable. Perfectionist overwork like this can result from anxiety about failure, and can ironically lead to increased anxiety when the approach inevitably becomes unsustainable. For more information on perfectionism, see the module titled: <em>Am I good enough?</em></p>
								<p>Heather could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Recognise that even high-achieving students like her can benefit from additional support to develop more effective study skills</li>
									<li>Ask her class tutor for a proper appointment to explain in more detail how she has been feeling and ask about further support</li>
									<li>Approach the welfare services to request counselling for anxiety and/or attend workshops to learn skills for managing anxiety and perfectionism. </li>
								</ul>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 10:</h4>
								<p>Fellow students are often the ones to notice when someone is not themselves. However, it might be difficult for a student like Heather, who is used to being the one offering support to others, to acknowledge their own need for support &ndash; so it is worth classmates using the 'ask twice' rule. This is when you follow up and ask again if someone initially says they are feeling OK.</p>
								<p>Heather could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Recognise that she has a lot going on and is setting very high expectations for herself</li>
									<li>Learn about the risks of perfectionism (see the module titled: <em>Am I good enough?</em>)</li>
									<li>Practise more self-care and self-compassion, as well as allowing herself to take up the offer of support from fellow students</li>
									<li>Look to meet other students with similar circumstances, to hear how others can also struggle with juggling their commitments and to obtain mutual support.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr>
								<h4>Scenario 6: Hari is worried about having to return home after graduation.</h4>
								<p>Hari couldn't wait to start a new life at a university, free from the rules and restrictions imposed by his conservative family. In his second year, he joined the LGBT+ Society, and has loved being connected to a community in which he feels supported. However, he is now procrastinating with his revision and is very stressed about trying to find a job before he finishes university. He is desperate not to have to move back home.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Parents:</strong> We had wanted Hari to study Law and we are regretting allowing him to switch to Film Studies where there isn't a clear career path after graduation. For now he just needs to focus on making sure that he gets very good results, then when he comes home he can start looking for a job. We are expecting him to come back home for a few years, so he can save up and then get married and settle down.</li>
									<li><strong>LGBT+ Society friends:</strong> We are worried about Hari. He says his parents will disown him if he comes out to them as gay, but it would be too hard for him to go back to hiding his identity. He isn't doing nearly enough work for his final exams, and he might even be in danger of failing the year &ndash; which is a bad way to put off finishing his degree! If he pushes himself now he can still do well, and then he should persuade his parents that he needs to do a Master's degree so he can stay on.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you recommended the advice from Hari's parents, continue to <strong>Feedback 11</strong>.
								<br>If you recommended the feedback from Hari's LGBTI society friends, continue to <strong>Feedback 12</strong>.</p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 11:</h4>
								<p>Many students and their families face difficult adjustments to new statuses and identities when they return to the family home as graduates. It may not always be possible to have open conversations to address these challenges. Managing conflicting expectations can be more difficult when graduates are going to remain financially dependent on their parents.</p>
								<p>Hari could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Recognise the significant psychological pressure he is under, due to the strong contrast between his parents' expectations and the identity he has been developing while at university</li>
									<li>Make full use of the free professional counselling usually available at university</li>
									<li>Talk things through with other neutral third parties, to consider his options more carefully</li>
									<li>Find a way to put aside any big decisions or plans until after his exams.</li>
								</ul>
								<hr>
								<h4>Feedback 12:</h4>
								<p>University study is often a personally transforming experience. The final year at university can often bring difficult inner conflicts to a head, putting extra pressure on students just when they most need to focus on their finals. It is a good idea to make use of the free professional counselling usually available at university to address identity issues as they arise, giving more time to work out how to manage them.</p>
								<p>Hari could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Avoid making hurried job applications while he is under pressure to prepare for his final assessments</li>
									<li>Get advice and support from academic staff to consider realistic options, e.g. whether a Master's would be a viable option</li>
									<li>Discuss this and his general job prospects with careers and employability advisors so that he can weigh his options with all the available information</li>
									<li>Make use of professional support to manage the pressure safely.</li>

										<p>If your friend shares with you that they are experiencing serious difficulties and you are worried for their safety, then you shouldn't agree to keep this to yourself.</p>
										<p>Tell them you need to seek guidance from a trusted staff member (for example, student support or counselling staff) and get advice about how to help them engage with professional help.</p>
										<p>Make sure you also get support for yourself if you have been impacted by hearing about or witnessing traumatic events or worrying behaviours.</p>
										<p>If you feel you would like to talk to someone, a good place to start is to check if your university has a counselling service.
