							<p>As a student, it can be challenging to keep up with healthy lifestyle practices, including eating properly, during busy and stressful times. Often when we are stressed we reach for comfort foods that are high in fat or sugar. This contributes to a poor diet, which can have a detrimental impact on our physical and mental wellbeing.</p>

								<central-concept>
									<node-heading>Poor nutrition</node-heading>
									<node-content>Not eating enough essential foods like vegetables, legumes, fruit or grains or frequently overindulging in foods that are high in sugar, salt or fat could have a short- and long-term impact on our health and wellbeing.</node-content>
								</central-concept>
								<concept-nodes>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Sleeping and wellbeing</node-heading>
										<node-content>Eating poorly may impact our immune system, making us more susceptible to illnesses and psychological stress. Eating a balanced diet can improve our mood, help us sleep better and improve concentration.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Physical health</node-heading>
										<node-content>Consistent high intake of foods rich in sugar, sodium (salt) or saturated fat has been found to increase the risk of developing obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and even some cancers.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Mental health</node-heading>
										<node-content>In recent years, research has shown that low intake of wholegrains, vegetables, fruit and other plant foods can contribute to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety (Wattick, R. <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Body image</node-heading>
										<node-content>The relationship we have with our bodies is influenced by a number of factors, and it is very possible for someone to eat well and have poor body image. However, poor nutrition can have a significant impact on our body and mind, including how we feel about ourselves. Therefore, dieting, skipping meals, eating poorly or overeating can contribute to a negative body image.</node-content>

							<p>Trying to implement better strategies to reduce stress (like spending time with friends or in nature, reading, or taking time out for your favourite hobby) could help to reduce the temptation to reach for unhealthy snacks. Helpful techniques for managing stress are explored in the module titled: <em>Stress, anxiety and depression</em>.</p>

So, a healthy diet was not my priority. However, my coach mentioned that eating poorly increases the risk of sport-related injuries. I use this knowledge as my motivation!</text-quote></p></opinion>

									img-alt="Mature white female"> <p><text-quote>I have a group of friends I like to study with. During exam preparation we would take turns bringing chocolates and sweets to the study session. However, after the initial sugar rush, we would end up feeling more tired and actually less able to focus on our studies. Now, we are trying to snack on fruit and nuts.</text-quote></p></opinion>

									img-alt="young black female"> <p><text-quote>Our society puts a lot of pressure on us to feel, look or behave in a certain way. I try to do my best when it comes to taking care of my health. This includes food, and most of the time I eat well. However, I've learned not to beat myself up if I have a 'bad' food day. When I get overwhelmed with the idea of being perfect, I try to focus on what is truly important: being well and taking care of myself.</text-quote></p></opinion></opinion>

							<p>Increasing your food knowledge can really help you take good care of your health through an adequate diet. However, if you find yourself avoiding eating or notice that your eating behaviours have changed dramatically, it may be helpful to talk to a trusted professional such as a counsellor or GP for advice.</p>
