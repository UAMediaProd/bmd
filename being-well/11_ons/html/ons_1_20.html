							<p>There is much written about being 'addicted' to various online activities, and the World
								Health Organization has now defined online addiction and gaming addiction as recognised
								mental health conditions. However, these addictions require clinical diagnosis and we are
								often too quick to claim addiction when what we actually mean is compulsive behaviour. This means persistent or repetitive behaviours that are not necessarily disruptive.</p>
							<p>This section considers a number of factors that might suggest signs of addiction but do not,
								of themselves, mean you are addicted to online activity. </p>
