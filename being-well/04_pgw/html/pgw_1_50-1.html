							<p>Feelings of imposter syndrome can be particularly prevalent for those students who feel as though they don't fit the 'standard' model of a postgraduate research student. This can include students from marginalised communities, such as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students; students from non-traditional backgrounds (such as first-in-family or those brought up in out-of-home care); international students; those with family or work commitments; and students with disabilities. Researchers returning to study from work may also be more likely to experience imposter syndrome.</p>

							<p>One aspect that can help to reduce feelings of imposter syndrome in particular is helpful feedback. However, many postgraduate research students either don't know how to ask their supervisor for the feedback that would be most helpful to them, or feel too intimidated to ask.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Consider the question, note down your response and click for feedback.</p></instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible><p>Consider your response to this question and then continue for feedback.</p></instructional-text-accessible>

								<note-question><p>When you next meet with your supervisor, what do you need to get feedback on in particular? Be specific and note down any questions you may have.</p></note-question>
								<note-input></note-input>
								<note-feedback>
									<p>If you are finding supervisory meetings difficult or that the feedback from your supervisor is not very helpful, there are a number of other options open to you:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Consider talking to your secondary supervisor or finding a mentor who can give you some support. Some universities provide mentoring schemes but, if yours doesn't, then consider approaching a friendly postgraduate student who is further ahead than you, or a postdoc, who might be able to provide some supportive and reassuring feedback</li>
										<li>Some institutions have strict guidelines about how often students meet with supervisors. In these instances, it can be a good idea to ask librarians for assistance &ndash; particularly during the research phase. Alternatively most universities have graduate schools or specialist teams to support researchers in doing their research and writing their thesis, so do look out for this support</li>
										<li>Conferences and training courses provide the opportunity to meet new people in a similar situation, and the chance to create a peer network for reviewing and support.</li>
									</ul>
								</note-feedback>
							</note-making>

							<p>For more information on tackling your inner critic, see the module titled: <em>Am I good enough?</em> While external help (e.g. from mentors or supervisors) is vital for managing the inner critic, it is also important to build a sense of self-confidence in your own abilities. See the module titled: <em>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience</em> for advice on how to develop these qualities.</p>
