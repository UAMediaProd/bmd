							<p>Perfectionism can influence many different aspects of student life. You might find revising for
								exams difficult &ndash; perfecting your notes or procrastinating to the point where your
								revision never actually gets done. Or, you might find giving presentations difficult because
								you find the idea of standing in front of people as they analyse your work to be unbearable.
								Some people even find that they have difficulty getting along with people, even people they
								care about such as friends and partners, because they have unrealistic expectations of how they should behave.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I have high expectations for the work I produce, and have always found working with others difficult. However, what really helped me was changing perspective. Now I focus on the idea that other people have skills I don't have, and try to think of it as an opportunity to learn. Other people can also share the workload, meaning more things get done. Most of all, things are a lot more fun and people are a lot more motivated when everyone is allowed to contribute in a meaningful way.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I'm a member of the Theatre Society, and we put on a couple of plays a year. I'd spent months working on the script for a new play I was also directing. During rehearsals, one of the actors kept coming up and giving his opinions on the characters, suggesting dialogue changes, etc. I found it really irritating and like he was suggesting my work wasn't good enough. During a coffee break, my friend from the group took me to one side and explained it wasn't necessarily personal, and that the actor was probably just as passionate about the project as I was. This helped me to understand that he deserved to have his thoughts heard, and I asked him if we could have a chat after the session rather than keep stopping the rehearsals. He apologised if he'd seemed overbearing, and we had a good working relationship after that.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>Sometimes perfectionism motivates me to work harder, but sometimes it's really paralysing. If I don't think I can do something perfectly, I might not do it at all. Perfectionism can stop me doing things I actually really want to try.</p></pod-quote>

										<h4>Question:</h4>
									</accessible-text>
									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>Why is Tracey so disappointed in her performance, despite trying her best? What might she have done differently?</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Tracey is displaying signs that she sets unrealistic expectations for herself. Rather than focusing on how well she could do given the circumstances, Tracey had set herself the goal of being top of the class and outperforming others. She overgeneralised her perceived failure ("I'm a failure", rather than "The work didn't get the grade I wanted") and discounted the information provided by the other students ("It was such a hard piece of music"). Having worked hard and not got the grade she wanted, she also has blamed herself. </p>
											<p>Tracey should have asked herself what grade was reasonable and realistic given the time she had, how familiar she was with the composer, and how difficult it was. It's OK to feel disappointed when you don't get the grade you want. However, it's important to try to react positively to setbacks. See the module titled: <em>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience</em> for more on dealing with challenging feedback.</p>

										<h4>Question:</h4>

									<note-making>
										<note-question>
											<p>Why did Theo wait until the last minute to submit his work? What might he have done differently?</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Theo was procrastinating &ndash; putting off the work until the last minute. This might be because he finds it difficult to start the work, or because he wants to use 'leaving it to the last minute' as an excuse if he doesn't get the mark he wants. The fact that he still wants a high mark, and he hopes to impress his friends, places him under a lot of pressure in this situation. This type of behaviour is typical of perfectionism; particularly when you believe others are expecting you to perform well, as it can make the idea of doing something less than perfectly feel like you will let people down.</p>
											<p>Planning is important at university, especially if you tend to procrastinate. It is easier to improve a draft than start from scratch. Don't set out to impress your friends or other students, and instead try to focus on producing work you are happy with. See the module titled: <em>Studying well</em> for more on tackling procrastination.</p>

										<note-question>
											<p>Why is Ajay behaving this way? What might he have done differently?</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Ajay is being too demanding, not taking into account other people's perspectives and the need to work together. By doing so, the work will suffer and so will his relationship with the other students. Ajay could have spoken with the students at the start to decide what grade they hoped to get and how they would best achieve it. Everyone has different strengths and there are roles for everyone. People tend not to respond well to being told what to do or being given constant negative feedback. By being positive and respectful, it is likely that the group will achieve more.</p>

							<p>While some people think that being perfectionistic can help to achieve better grades, it is
								actually more likely to make student life much harder. You will need to learn new things
								that you are not familiar with, work with other people, and your work will be assessed a
								lot. There will be ups and downs &ndash; successes and failures. If you want to truly succeed at
								university, you will need to be less, not more, perfectionistic. </p>
