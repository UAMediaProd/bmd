									<p>If your account details are stolen or money is taken from your account by an unknown source, contact your bank immediately. They will be able to investigate the issue, and hopefully even arrange for all, or some, of the money to be returned.</p>

							<p>It is important that you protect your personal details so that you can prevent yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft.</p>
							<p>Your personal details may be used fraudulently by someone else to buy goods and services online, or to apply for bank accounts, loans or mobile phone contracts. Not only could this cost you financially, but it could also mean that your credit rating is affected, making it difficult for you get a loan or even a mortgage in the future (for more on credit ratings, see the module titled: <em>Financial awareness</em>).</p>

							<p>Passwords are crucial in order to protect your data. Think about how you make up your passwords so that they aren't easy to guess. Passwords should have a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols, so people and password-cracking software can't guess them too easily.</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Weak password: smellycat</li>
									<li>Moderate password: sm3llycat</li>
									<li>Strong password: &dollar;m3llYcat</li>

							<p>Phishing is a criminal activity where someone pretending to be from a legitimate organisation (such as a bank or a charity) tries to get a person to hand over information such as date of birth, username and password or credit card details. This information is then often used to take money from someone's account. Phishing often happens in the form of an email or text message.</p>
							<p>Contrary to what you may think, research suggests that young people are more likely to become victims of phishing scams than older people.</p>

							<p>While the example above is deliberately error-laden, bear in mind that some phishing emails can be very convincing. Many people fall victim to identity fraud through phishing attacks. If it happens to you, contact your bank or get help from the organisations in the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod.</p>
							<p>Avoiding identity theft:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Protect your devices with security software that requires logins to access </li>
									<li>Use strong passwords made up of letters, numbers and punctuation</li>
									<li>Don't share your passwords with other people</li>
									<li>Change your passwords frequently</li>
									<li>Do not use the same password for everything</li>
									<li>Only purchase from reputable sites</li>
									<li>Monitor your credit score through a service such as Experian or Equifax</li>
									<li>Report unrecognised purchases as soon as you spot them.</li>
								</ul>
