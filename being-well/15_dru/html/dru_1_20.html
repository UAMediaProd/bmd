							<p>All recreational drugs are also considered <glossary content="Substances that alter perception, decision-making, mood, cognition and behaviour.">psychoactive substances</glossary>. Psychoactive drugs are classified according to their effect on the mind, which can vary hugely.</p>
							<p>Bear in mind that even if you don't use or plan to take psychoactive drugs for recreational purposes, all this information will still be useful, as many of these drugs are also used for medical and performance-enhancing purposes. Your family and friends may also consume drugs for recreational purposes and this knowledge will be useful if you need to offer help or advice.</p>

								<central-concept>
									<node-heading>Psychoactive drugs</node-heading>
									<node-content>
										<p>Drugs with emotion- and mind-altering properties. They alter mood, consciousness,
											cognition, perception and/or behaviour.</p>
									</node-content>
								</central-concept>

									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Stimulants</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Stimulants are drugs that improve attention and mood. In medicine, they are well known for treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), sleep disorders and obesity. Some stimulants are legal (like caffeine), while others (like speed, ice or cocaine) are illegal in most countries. Stimulants can be highly addictive.</p>
											<p>Common examples:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Nicotine</li>
												<li>Cocaine</li>
												<li>Amphetamine</li>
												<li>Methamphetamine ('meth', 'ice', 'crystal', 'speed' or 'base')</li>
												<li>Dexamphetamine ('dexies')</li>
												<li>Methylphenidate (e.g. 'Ritalin')</li>
											</ul>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Empathogens</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Empathogens are drugs that have strong social and emotional effects. People
												are more empathetic and sympathetic under the influence of these drugs. They
												are mainly used in the club scene. Scientists are exploring the therapeutic
												uses of empathogens in psychotherapy.</p>
											<p>Common examples:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>MDMA ('Ecstasy', 'E', 'pingers', 'caps', 'molly')</li>
												<li>Mephedrone ('meow-meow')</li>
											</ul>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Dissociatives</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Dissociative drugs produce the feeling of the mind detaching from the body
												and the environment. They also alter the sensory perception and produce
												dream-like states. Some dissociative drugs (e.g. ketamine) are used for
												medical and veterinary purposes.</p>
											<p>Common examples:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Ketamine ('special K')</li>
												<li>PCP ('angel dust')</li>
												<li>Nitrous oxide ('nangs')</li>
											</ul>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Cannabinoids</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Cannabinoids are drugs with effects and chemical structures similar to the
												natural compounds found in the cannabis plant. They have physical and
												cognitive side-effects, which include dehydration, changes in appetite and
												forgetfulness, among others. The cannabis plant is consumed recreationally
												worldwide. In medical settings, it is increasingly being used to treat
												various conditions such as epilepsy and chronic pain.</p>
											<p>Common examples:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Cannabis</li>
												<li>Hash</li>
												<li>CBD oil</li>
												<li>THC oil</li>
											</ul>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Depressants</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Depressants are drugs that reduce stimulation and arousal. These drugs induce
												sedation, muscle relaxation and loss of coordination. They can also trigger
												a feeling of euphoria and being uninhibited. Recreationally, alcohol is the
												most consumed drug in this category and also the most used recreational
												drug. Clinically, depressants are mainly used to treat neuropsychiatric
												disorders such as anxiety and depression.</p>
											<p>Common examples:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Alcohol</li>
												<li>GHB ('G' or 'GBH')</li>
												<li>Benzodiazepines (e.g. Xanax, Valium)</li>
												<li>Barbiturates ('downers')</li>
											</ul>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Opioids</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Opiates are drugs derived from the poppy plant. They cause euphoria and
												sedation, which are the main effects sought by recreational users of
												opioids. They are widely used in clinical settings for pain relief. They are
												considered one of the most harmful drugs because of their high potential for
												addiction in both recreational and medical settings.</p>
											<p>Common examples:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Heroin</li>
												<li>Fentanyl</li>
												<li>Morphine</li>
												<li>Codeine</li>
												<li>Oxycodone ('oxy')</li>
											</ul>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Psychedelics</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Psychedelics are drugs that alter mood, perception and consciousness. The
												effects include hallucinations, time distortion, euphoria and enhanced
												creativity, among others. These drugs have been used historically in
												recreational and spiritual contexts. Research is exploring their potential
												for therapeutic use to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. </p>
											<p>Common examples:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>LSD</li>
												<li>Psilocybin mushrooms ('magic mushrooms')</li>
												<li>DMT</li>
												<li>Mescaline</li>

										<p>Most drugs have 'street names'. For example, cannabis is often called <strong>weed</strong>, <strong>spliff</strong>, <strong>marijuana</strong>, <strong>skunk</strong>, <strong>hash</strong> or <strong>pot</strong>. </p>
										<p>You often hear people saying <strong>molly</strong>, <strong>mandy</strong>, <strong>E</strong>, <strong>pingers</strong>, <strong>caps</strong>, <strong>ecstasy</strong>, <strong>X</strong> or <strong>XTC</strong> instead of MDMA, and cocaine is called <strong>charlie</strong>, <strong>coke</strong>, <strong>snow</strong> or <strong>crack rock</strong>.</p>
										<p>I've heard ketamine called <strong>ket</strong>, <strong>special k</strong>, <strong>K</strong>, or <strong>kit-kat</strong>, and people call LSD <strong>acid</strong>, <strong>tab</strong> or <strong>lucy</strong>.</p>

									<p>Recreational drug use often happens in a social context. When consuming drugs with friends, it is advisable to stick together and frequently check in on how everyone is feeling.</p>
									<p>When consuming psychedelics, it is a sensible harm reduction strategy to designate a 'tripsitter'. This person stays sober with the aim of taking care of the group. Ideally, this person has experience with psychedelics, so they understand how the others may feel. The tripsitter should help the group with the basics, such as providing water and food, as well as being on hand to help anyone having a bad psychological experience.</p>
									<p>If any of your friends show any of the following signs while taking drugs, seek medical help immediately:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Short or irregular breathing</li>
										<li>Pale or blue-tinged skin (remember that this discolouration is less visible the darker the pigment of the skin)</li>
										<li>Extremely low or high body temperature</li>
										<li>Being unresponsive</li>
										<li>Passing out</li>
									</ul>
									<p>No one will get into trouble, even if they have consumed illegal substances.</p>

							<p>In Australia, drug laws are the responsibility of the states and territories, which means that there are significant differences between jurisdictions. Most psychoactive substances are banned for manufacture, distribution, possession and use, except alcohol, tobacco and medicinal products in all states, and cannabis in the ACT where it is legal to grow, possess and use small amounts for personal use. Cannabis is also available through prescription for a limited number of medicinal uses. Most other drugs come under the criminal code, except in the Northern Territory and South Australia where cannabis is decriminalised.</p>
							<p>Nearly 700 new psychoactive substances ('NPS') have been identified globally in the past decade. These synthetic drugs are designed to mimic the effects of common illicit drugs such as cannabis, MDMA or cocaine. Until recently, drugs needed to be specifically listed to be considered illegal, but most Australian states and territories now ban the possession or sale of any substance that has a psychoactive effect, other than those listed above.</p>

							<text-block>
								<p>Some common names by drug type are (Victoria State Government, 2018):</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Stimulant-type drugs:</strong> BZP, mephedrone, MDPV, NRG-1, Benzo Fury, MDAI and ethylphenidate</li>
									<li><strong>Depressant-type drugs:</strong> Etizolam, Pyrazolam, Flubromazepam and nitrous oxide</li>
									<li><strong>Hallucinogenic drugs:</strong> 25i-NBOMe and 1p-LSD</li>
									<li><strong>Synthetic cannabinoids:</strong> Spice, Clockwork Orange, Black Mamba and Exodus Damnation (these are not derived from the cannabis plant).</li>
								</ul>
							</text-block>

							<p>The problem with these substances is that we know very little about their effects. If you
								encounter any of these substances, don't trust the packaging and do your own research if you
								plan to try them.</p>
