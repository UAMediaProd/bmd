							<p>When you start a course of university study or research, you set out on an exciting journey
								of personal transformation. This journey as a student has many changes and challenges along
								the way; from when you first apply to university to after you graduate, you will regularly
								face new tasks and methods to master, new levels of knowledge and understanding to reach,
								and higher standards of assessment to attain. Along the way there may be lots of life
								changes too &ndash; in your circumstances, surroundings, relationships and responsibilities.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>It's a clich&eacute; that coming to university feels like suddenly being a small fish in a very big ocean, rather than the big fish in a small pond that you are when you finish Year 12. That was true for me, but I really enjoyed first year, not taking the learning very seriously and just doing a lot of partying. It was during my second year that I started to find things a lot more challenging academically, and I regretted not getting into better study habits. My study support tutor gave me some helpful advice, and set me on a better path.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I'm autistic and my uni was very helpful with extra support for getting settled in &ndash; I came up early and had tours and taster sessions, so I knew where I was going and could cope better once the crowds arrived. I am also benefitting from a university research programme which uses profiling tools to help autistic students identify their unique skills. The aim is to match these skills with job opportunities.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Rory, 22</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I've just started a PhD, but I'm feeling a bit daunted as I will be doing it part-time alongside my job as a science teacher. My supervisor is supportive, but I haven't met anyone else in the department who's doing their PhD part-time. Luckily I found a network for postgraduate researchers run by the university's student organisation, and there are quite a few other part-timers on there. We're going to try to meet up in person now and again, if we can.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>My ATAR results were lower than expected and so I got my uni place through an alternative entry pathway. I hadn't even come to an open day and knew no one else coming here. My heart wasn't really in it at first and I didn't make much effort to get to know people. But gradually I realised how good the course was &ndash; there was a real focus on teaching and student support, and the lecturers were so enthusiastic. I put more effort into talking to others in my seminars and gradually made a good group of friends. I'm in my final year now, and I'm even considering staying on for a Master's.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Shannon, 21</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I've got an hour and a half commute each way to get to and from uni, which is quite a big chunk of the day. I got involved with a network for commuter students organised by the students' association, which helped me meet students in the same situation as me. We swap tips about how to make the most of commuting time for study. The students' association helped us lobby the university to make sure the course coordinators were aware of our needs.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I left school at 16 and worked my way up within the banking sector. It has been a massive adjustment coming to university as a mature student. It has meant quite a sacrifice for the family as a whole, due to the drop in income, and I've had to figure out how to juggle various caring commitments alongside the study. But I'm loving the challenge of the course &ndash; it is opening up so many new opportunities for me, and maybe even a whole new career. All the juggling feels worth it.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Maria, 43</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>It's hard to move away from family, having grown up with my community and lived in a town where everyone knows who you are. But I guess it's important, doing it for the mob &ndash; that's why I'm doing it. There are so many students at university who don't know the history of this country or how our people are treated on a day-to-day basis &ndash; it's going to be a challenge but my family supports me to make a difference.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>Where are <em>you</em> in your student journey? Are you just settling into a new stage, or do you have a change up ahead?
							Each new stage can involve a mixture of feelings &ndash; things you are glad to move on from, but also some things you will miss; new challenges that seem daunting at first, but also new things to look forward to.</p>

							<instructional-text>
								<p>Reflect on your own position in the student journey &ndash; either the stage you are currently settling in to, or the next stage if you will soon be moving on. For each question, write down your thoughts, then read our advice.</p>
