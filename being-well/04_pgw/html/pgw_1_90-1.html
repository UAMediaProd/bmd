							<p>Now that we've reached the end of this module, you should have some ideas for how you can thrive in, rather than just survive, your postgraduate research journey! This section offers you the opportunity to collate these ideas together in an action plan.</p>
							
							<instructional-text><p>Using the learning you've gained from the module, note down up to six ideas about how you could improve your wellbeing while conducting postgraduate research. Write the first point and then click on the 'Plus' symbol to reveal the next space. If you write fewer than six points you must click on the 'Plus' symbol to ensure that your text is captured in the summary.</p></instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible><p>Using the learning you've gained from the module, list up to six ideas about how you could improve your wellbeing while conducting postgraduate research. For example, you might decide to check the graduate school website for any training courses that can help to improve your academic writing skills and expand your peer network.</p></instructional-text-accessible>
