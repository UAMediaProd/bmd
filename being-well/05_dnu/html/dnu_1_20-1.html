							<p>You may have heard that 80% of the human body is made up of water. It is no wonder, then, that optimal hydration is essential for physical performance, cognitive functioning and even mood (Masento, N. <em>et al.</em> 2014). A variety of drinks can provide us with the hydration we need; however, water is always the best choice as it's usually freely available, and has no calories or added sugars to damage your teeth.</p>
							<p>Some signs of dehydration include:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Increased thirst, or dry mouth or lips </li>
									<li>Headache, tiredness or poor concentration</li>
									<li>Decreased urine output and dark urine.</li>
								</ul>

							<p>It is particularly important to remember to stay hydrated when you are very busy with physical or mental challenges, such as during workouts or exam time. Sometimes that's easier said than done, but there are some simple ways you can up your water intake.</p>

							<p>Most healthy adults need at least 2-2.5 litres of water per day (Armstrong, L. & Johnson, E., 2018). So, it is a good idea to keep a bottle of water handy at all times.</p>
							<p>How hydrated are you right now?</p>
