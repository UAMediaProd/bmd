							<p>Although many students have very positive experiences working with others, there are occasions when exploitation by the academic community and/or supervisors does occur. Some researchers feel embarrassed to discuss exploitation or even feel obliged to allow exploitation to continue &ndash; it is normal to feel this way.  In these circumstances it is important that you recognise when there is a serious problem and take action quickly to prevent it from getting any worse.</p>
							<p>This can feel like a daunting thing to have to do, but any sort of exploitative or bullying behaviour is totally unacceptable and must be addressed. Most universities have codes of conduct and policies governing appropriate behaviour so do check out the information that your university has on this.</p>

									<action-question>Phillipa's supervisor has shouted at her in front of the rest of the students at least three times in the past two months. Each time, the supervisor has come in the next day with a small gift, like chocolates or flowers, to give to Phillipa as an apology. He has also been implying to Phillipa that their relationship is more than just a student-supervisor one, and she therefore can't say anything about the yelling. Phillipa is feeling very uncomfortable about the situation. What should she do?</action-question>

								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="1">
									<action-question>Phillipa should report the behaviour and not just continue to 'cope' with it. This behaviour is bullying and harassment, and is compounded by the supervisor trying to manipulate her by bringing her presents as an apology and to buy her silence. There is an element of sexual harassment in this as well. The behaviour needs to be reported to the director of postgraduate studies/head of department and stopped. It is understandably intimidating for Phillipa to report this so she might perhaps try to get some of her fellow students who witnessed it to come with her and support her. Phillipa should also try to talk to her second supervisor (if she has one) to see if the second supervisor can be supportive and may be able to take over as first supervisor.</action-question>

									<action-question>Mo has been working on writing a journal article with his two supervisors and a postdoctoral research fellow in the same department. Mo has done most of the analysis of the research (as it is his project) and has written nearly the entire article himself as his supervisors told him it would be a good experience for him.  Eventually the paper is accepted by a journal but, when it is published, Mo finds that he is the fourth author (least significant contribution) on the paper rather than being the first (most significant contribution) as he had expected.

							<p>Exploitation of doctoral students is not the norm, but when it does occur it can have a huge impact on the student. The only way to make exploitation absolutely unacceptable is to ensure that it is exposed, and this may involve you making a formal complaint if you are on the receiving end of this behaviour.  If you are involved in a complaints procedure, you will need a lot of support so do ensure that you reach out to friends and student services.</p>
