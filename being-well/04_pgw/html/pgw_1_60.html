							<p>Your relationship with your supervisors is key to the success of your research project. It is common to experience road blocks in this relationship as it develops alongside your research, and this module is designed to help you identify and manage them. Your university should ensure that you have 2 or more supervisors and that they are experienced and well supported through university processes and training. Good supervisors will be supportive during the research process, as well as challenging you to get the most out of your research project. Many students remain in touch with their supervisors for years to come as they progress in their academic careers &ndash; some even collaborate on further research.</p>
							<p>The research project is <em>your</em> project, however, and it is therefore worth considering how you can manage the relationship with your supervisor(s) so that you can get the support and guidance that you need.</p>

							<p>You may have chosen to do your research project with a particular supervisor because they are eminent in the field, but this should not inhibit you in asking your supervisor for the support that you need. In addition, you may need to take the responsibility for organising meetings, setting an agenda and recording and circulating notes for your supervisory meetings. All of these actions will help you feel more in control of managing your research project.</p>

                                    <pod-quote><p>My original supervisor was frankly quite a bully. Lots of the students in my lab had a problem with him but were too afraid to say anything. I put up with him shouting at me a few times but after I found myself crying after class, I decided that I really needed to say something. I was absolutely terrified that I would be blamed so I asked to see the department director of graduate studies confidentially. He was surprisingly sympathetic and understanding. I was assigned a new first supervisor &ndash; who was absolutely lovely and really passionate about my research &ndash; and my original supervisor was kept on as a second, but was definitely kept in check by the new first supervisor.  In the end, he calmed down and was really helpful with suggestions for my write-up. It must have been a bit of a shock for him because he also started to be nicer to everyone else in the lab. It was horrid complaining about him but I'm really glad that I did it.</p></pod-quote>
