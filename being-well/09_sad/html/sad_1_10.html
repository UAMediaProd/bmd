							<p>When we feel under pressure or worried, we often say we are 'stressed'.</p>
							<p>We sometimes feel anxious when we are dealing with uncertainty. We sometimes talk about being 'depressed' when we've had a setback or are temporarily feeling low. How can we tell when these feelings are 'normal' parts of life, or when they have become problematic stress, anxiety or depression?</p>

							<p>Stress is part of the ups and downs of student life. But, if you are under sustained stress or don't have good <glossary placement="bottom" content="The practice of taking an active role in protecting our physical, emotional and mental health, and general sense of wellbeing. This is particularly important in times of stress.">self-care</glossary> strategies in place, it can become problematic stress, anxiety or depression. Anxiety is part of the body's normal stress response and usually settles down after the specific threat has passed. However, some people find themselves feeling on edge or worried all of the time. If so, this may be an anxiety disorder. It is normal to have good and bad days, or feel down sometimes. But if we feel very sad, flat or numb most of the time then we may be experiencing depression. It can be difficult to tell the difference between these feelings. What does having an anxiety disorder or depression mean for some people? And what do people often believe about them?</p>
