							<p>Sexual health is not only about looking after our own wellbeing; it's also about helping to create a positive environment around us so that others can look after their sexual health as well.</p>
							<p>As we discussed earlier, consent is a vital component of sex, and must be genuine, consistent, enthusiastic and non-coercive. As well as checking that your partner has given consent, and feeling empowered to give or withhold consent yourself, it's important to be a <glossary content="Someone who notices a situation that causes them concern, and does something about it.">positive bystander</glossary> if you feel someone is unable to give consent (for example, they are drunk or unconscious), or that they are being pressured into a sexual interaction they aren't comfortable with.</p>

									<p>'Slut shaming' is judging a person negatively because of the number of sexual partners they've had, or the things they've done sexually. Just because someone has a different relationship to sex than you, it doesn't mean they have the right to pass comment, or that you have the right to lecture them in return.</p>

							<p>In the scenarios we've just seen, a bystander stepped in to make sure someone else was OK. This can be as simple as a quiet word to check someone is feeling comfortable, or alerting venue staff if you're worried that someone is being sexually harassed or pressured into sex. Although this can feel intimidating, it is important to look out for one another and it is better to have a slight misunderstanding than for someone to feel that they are unable to give their consent. There is more information on positive bystander intervention in the module titled: <em>Healthy relationships.</em></p>

										<p>If a friend tells you they have been sexually assaulted, here are three things you can do to support them:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Believe them</li>
											<li>Remind them that it was not their fault</li>
											<li>Help them seek support services (such as the <a href="https://www.1800respect.org.au/" target="_blank">RESPECT rape crisis helpline</a>, or making a sexual health appointment) if they want to, but don't pressure them if they're not ready to report the incident.</li>

							<p>As well as being a positive bystander, there are some other things we can do to promote a responsible attitude to sex:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Being empathetic, supportive, and non-judgemental when our friends tell us things about their sex lives and relationships &ndash; even if they do things differently from us</li>
									<li>Modelling good sexual health behaviours, such as mentioning that you had a routine STI check-up, helps your friends feel like it's a normal and OK thing to do</li>
									<li>Knowing your sexual health basics (like what services there are at university, or where to get free condoms) so you can give your friends advice when they need it.</li>

								<p>If you rated yourself as 'Confident' or 'OK' for most of the items in this list, you're doing a great job at supporting your friends and peers in their sexual wellbeing! For items that you rated yourself 'Needs work', add them to your action plan on the <em>Action plan</em> screen.</p>

							<p>Joking about sex might be easy, but talking openly about sex and sexual health can be hard! You don't have to get it right every time, but making the effort to support your friends by taking their concerns seriously and reacting without judgement can go a long way.</p>
