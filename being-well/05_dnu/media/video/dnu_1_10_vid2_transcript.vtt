Since moving out of home, I've noticed that I do tend to just stick to stuff that I know how to make, that's easy, and affordable.

Over the course of my university studies, my eating habits have changed a little bit. Initially, when I was in high school, I used to eat a lot of junk food. And it was a lot of chocolate, a lot of chips. That kept up with part of my first year of university studies. But by the time I entered my third year, I found that I started to eat healthier or at least, reduced the amount of snacking.

I'd say, some of my eating preferences have changed. I think, certainly, money factors into a lot of the way that-- the food I shop, and what I cook and eat. So I think, healthy, fast quick, cheap meals are what my diet's of changed to at university.

My eating habits have definitely changed since I moved to uni. These days, I'm looking for a really quick and easy meals that I can cook up. And generally, I want those done-- eaten and cooked within half an hour so I can get on with my day.
