							<p>Humans are emotional beings. We will all feel (and behave) in a variety of ways throughout our lives, depending on what is happening to us at the time.</p>
							<p>Emotions are a normal part of life, but sometimes they can be difficult to manage and we may need help to cope with them. We may also need support with some of the unhelpful behaviour patterns that we can fall into when we are stressed, anxious or depressed.</p>

									<p>When we say 'ask for support', this can mean a few things, depending on your situation. It might mean talking to a friend, family member or university counsellor. If you feel isolated or lonely, it may mean looking at what clubs and groups operate at your university and joining one of them. The idea is to simply reach out and make a connection with another person who can help you take the next step.</p>
