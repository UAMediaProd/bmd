							<p>Image-based abuse can be very distressing, and includes the sharing of explicit or intimate pictures taken without the agreement (consent) of the person. Images may also have been taken with the consent of the person, or shared willingly, but this does not mean that the recipient has automatic permission to share them with other people. This is still non-consensual sharing. </p>
							<p>This behaviour is often referred to as revenge pornography, and while a perpetrator might argue that such sharing is done for revenge it is actually done to <em>abuse</em>, and not for sexual gratification.</p>
							<p>Sadly, people are often too embarrassed to report these incidents or they don't know how to. Revenge pornography is illegal under federal law &ndash; specifically, the Enhancing Online Safety (Non consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Act 2018. You can report incidents to the Office of the eSafety Commisioner, where you can also find formal takedown notices for platform providers (see <em>Resource bank</em> screen for details).</p>

							<p>It is important to understand that image-based abuse can manifest in different forms, not just at the end of a relationship. Perpetrators might have many reasons for doing it, and many victims don't realise it is illegal or that they can do anything about it. </p>

										<mcq-question>A couple is breaking up after a long-term relationship. While in the process of breakup one of the partners distributes sexual images of the other via WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</mcq-question>

										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>This is image-based abuse and the partner who distributed the images could be charged under the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Act 2018, as they were shared with the intention of causing distress.</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>A man has taken the Facebook profile picture of his ex-partner and Photoshopped the image. The image now depicts the person naked and engaging in sexual activity.</mcq-question>

										<mcq-feedback>In some Australian states, the creation and distribution of "altered images" is now illegal (for example, in NSW, the ACT and WA) and carries a maximum sentence of 3 years. However, there is no federal law to cover this issue nationally. You can report incidents to the Office of the eSafety Commisioner, where you can also find formal takedown notices for platform providers. </mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question> A woman has called the police to report her images being posted online. The images depict her standing in her underwear.</mcq-question>

												<mcq-answer>Legal

										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>The Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Act defines the sharing of "intimate images". It is unlikely that an image of someone in their underwear would meet the threshold to be considered an 'intimate image'. However, the posting of these sorts of images can still be upsetting, and the victim could contact the platform providers to take the images down.</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>Your friend has some indecent images of a 15-year-old on their phone that were shared with them while they were at school. They say it's OK to keep them because they didn't take the images or share them, they just received them.</mcq-question>

										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>While this does not fall under the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Act because there is no way to determine whether the images were shared consensually, the possession of indecent images of a minor is a serious crime, and possession can result in criminal charges should your friend's phone be searched by the police for any reason.</mcq-feedback>
