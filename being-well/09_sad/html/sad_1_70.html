							<p>This module will hopefully have helped you to clarify the differences between stress, anxiety disorders and depression. It should have helped you to discover what to watch out for in yourself or your friends, and when to seek help from a trusted professional. You may also now have lots of ideas and feel enthusiastic about some of the activities you can try to keep yourself feeling and functioning well.</p>

									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>Doing nice things for yourself is a wonderful way to feel good, especially if you have been having a difficult time. Try a combination of things that you know will work for you, and one or two new activities. You could do some of this with a friend. Make time for yourself, build in rest days, and plan nice things to have to look forward to each week.</p>

									<ladder-number>2</ladder-number>
									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>We all feel stressed sometimes, but if you feel anxious, down or bad enough that it is interfering with your everyday activities most of the time, then you should not ignore this. Ask for help from a friend or professional you trust and start to get back on track.</p>

									<ladder-number>1</ladder-number>
									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>You should choose someone you trust &ndash; who will be compassionate and kind, and will listen and not judge. This may be a friend, a family member, a trained student peer, a volunteer from a charity, or a health professional at your university or in the community.</p>

							<!-- ACTIVITY END -->

							<p>To some extent, university will be a stressful time for all students. However, for some people it can prove more challenging and lead to problematic anxiety and even depression, or a recurrence of a previous issue. Don't ignore these feelings if they are worrying you. It is always better to seek advice and help early. Take the time to look after yourself, and stay healthy and happy at university.</p>
