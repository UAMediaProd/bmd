							<p>At a basic level, psychoactive drugs affect us because they mimic <glossary placement="bottom" header="molecules"content="The smallest chemical structure, composed by atoms that take part in a chemical reaction.">molecules</glossary> that we have in our nervous system. They change how <glossary placement="bottom" content="Cells that specialise in transmitting information throughout the body.">neurons</glossary> would normally talk and respond to each other. Neurons in the nervous system mediate the mind and behaviour with a balance of excitation and inhibition. After consuming drugs, the usual balance of <glossary placement="bottom" content="Chemicals that neurons use to communicate with each other.">neurotransmitters</glossary>  changes.</p>
							<p>After the experience is over, neurons will adapt again, but this takes some time. Because of this, people often feel the opposite to the effects of the drug during a 'comedown'. This is why it's very important to rest well, drink water, eat nutritious food and take time off the day after taking psychoactive drugs. Taking more of a drug can counteract withdrawal symptoms in the short-term, but this can easily lead to dependency and addiction.</p>

											<p>Kenny is a Maths student. He tried cannabis in high school a few times. He has always been a responsible and high-achieving student. He's now living in student accommodation at university and has started smoking cannabis daily to relax. People have started to joke that he seems to be high all the time. What effect could this habit have on his academic and personal life?</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Kenny's behaviour seems like a typical example of someone who is self-medicating with cannabis. Smoking cannabis might make him feel more relaxed, but it seems as though he is using it as a mechanism to cope with his stress. In the long-term, smoking cannabis every day may contribute to anxiety disorders, reduced concentration and irritability, among others.</p>

											<p>Messing too much with a sleeping schedule and consuming psychoactive drugs during the weekend will have a negative impact on most people's wellbeing and mood.

											<p>Karishma is a first-year student. She goes out an average of three times a week and often drinks heavily and drops MDMA a couple of times a month. She is doing well, but feels she can do much better, and is confident that she will completely stop partying for the final exams. She plans to take modafinil to boost her concentration and productivity while she studies. How will her studying strategy affect her mental health and performance?</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Karishma is confident about her abilities but fails to acknowledge the importance of her mental health and emotional wellbeing. She might still do well in her exams, but her studying strategy is likely to put her body and mind under stress. Modafinil can make it difficult to fall asleep, leading to sleep deprivation. If she cannot rest properly, she is likely to burn out and find it hard to concentrate at a critical time, leading to problematic anxiety.</p>

											<p>Mark and Carlos are Master's students. They are sharing a house with two other postgraduate students, who they know from their undergraduate years. Mark and Carlos have never tried drugs, and don't enjoy drinking alcohol. However, their housemates have people over for pre-drinks, smoke cannabis daily and occasionally take other drugs. They have common friends and share an interest in sports and video games. How might their different approach to drug use affect the dynamics of living together?</p>
										</note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>
											<p>Everyone has a different routine, and while the evening behaviours of their housemates may cause Mark and Carlos irritation, it is possible that they are equally as disruptive in different ways (e.g. noisily leaving the house early when others are sleeping). However, it is important to feel comfortable in your home, and if Mark and Carlos are bothered by the smoke, noise or mess, it is important that they speak up and share their concerns. Perhaps they could come to an agreement that there is no smoking in the house, and a set time for pre-drinks to end. They could also suggest some new group activities based around their common interests, such as video game nights or five-a-side football matches. Conflict resolution skills are discussed in more detail in the module titled: <em> Your student journey</em>.</p>

								<p>Kenny is a Maths student. He tried cannabis in high school a few times. He has always been a responsible and high-achieving student.

										<p>If you are worried about a friend's drug-taking habits, try to have an honest conversation with them. You want to help them, but you are not in a position to provide medical help. It is a difficult conversation so follow this advice to help your friend open up and find solutions to change:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Never corner someone and embarrass them about their drug-taking habits. Raising the issue in a respectful and non-judgemental way will usually have a positive result</li>
											<li>Ask them open, indirect questions about their drug-taking habits. For example: "What do you enjoy the most about going out?" This will help to bring the topic around to drugs in a natural way</li>
											<li>If you can't think of more open questions to continue the discussion, simply reflect on what your friend is telling you. For instance, if they say: "I might be smoking too much cannabis lately, I feel spaced out all the time", you might reply: "Sorry to hear you're feeling spaced out, do you think it's connected to the smoking?" This shows that you are listening actively and taking in what they are saying</li>
											<li>Highlight anything positive about your friend's behaviour in relation to drug-taking. For example, if you friend proudly tells you that they did not use drugs on a night out, say something like: "That's really good, you are on the right track".</li>
										</ul>

									<pod-quote><p>I take some drugs, but I refuse to do coke. I find it unethical because the trade of this drug is responsible for so much corruption and violence and I don't want to be a part of it.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I used to smoke weed when I was an undergraduate student, but I stopped when I started working. I would get super anxious at work and then I could only think about work when I was high. It was really disturbing. Now, I'm finding it easier to focus on my Master's degree.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Tanu, 28</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I don't take any drugs at all, not even coffee. I'm doing my PhD in theoretical maths. Sleeping well and doing sports is what works the best for me. I need to work a lot but I get to socialise through sports and I love it!</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Ru, 25</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>At first, I didn't enjoy life in shared housing. I shared a flat with people whose lifestyle was completely different to mine. They were really into partying and took drugs in the communal areas. I made some new friends at an event, and found out that they lived in the same block. I asked to be moved to their flat and now I feel very comfortable here.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Jade, 18</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>In my first year, I used to take either ketamine or ecstasy every weekend. I had a great time, but it became harder and harder to feel energetic and positive the following days. Now, I use them very occasionally, and only when I know the comedown won't affect my work.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>All psychoactive drugs mess with the equilibrium of the brain. To avoid this, the best course of action is, of course, not to consume them at all. However, if you were to consume them, be aware of these effects and take a harm reduction approach. You will not only avoid immediate harm, but you will reduce the risk of long-term harm to your mental health and wellbeing.</p>
