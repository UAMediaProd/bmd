							<text-quote>
								<p><strong>A state of physical, mental and social wellbeing in relation to sexuality.

											<p>Quick check-in questions are important for practising sexual consent. Which of these is <strong>not</strong> an example of a good consent question?</p>
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>"Why won't you do that?" </mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p>Consent is an important part of sexual health. Checking in about using condoms or other protection, and about the things you are comfortable doing in bed, helps keep everyone safe (and helps you have a good time too!). Consent needs to be genuine, consistent, enthusiastic and non-coercive &ndash; so basically it's about asking questions and listening to the answers. Asking a question like "Why won't you do that?" puts pressure on the other person to justify their decision, implying that you don't respect or agree with it.</p>

										<mcq-question>
											<p>Which of these are possible symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection?</p>
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Sores or bumps on the skin</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Unusual discharge</mcq-answer>

											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>All of the above </mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p>All of these symptoms are possible signs of a sexually transmitted infection. But it's also common to have no symptoms at all. That's why it's important to get regular sexual health checks, even if you don't have any signs of infection. See the screen titled: <em>Signs, symptoms and testing</em> for more information.</p>

										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Withdrawing before ejaculation </mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p>The most effective contraceptives are IUDs, implants, and the pill. Condoms are also highly effective when used correctly. Sticking to external play is also effective (just make sure no semen gets on the vulva). Withdrawing is not considered a contraceptive method, since pregnancy can still occur even before ejaculation.</p>

										<mcq-question>
											<p>STIs can be transmitted by:</p>
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Oral sex</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>

											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>All of the above</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p>There's no shame in getting an STI diagnosis, it's just an infection that needs treatment &ndash; like other health issues. Different STIs can be transmitted by the sharing of bodily fluids and through skin-to-skin contact. If someone has an STI, it does not mean they have had a lot of partners, or that they have poor hygiene practices, or that anyone was unfaithful. Everyone's story is different.</p>

										<mcq-question>
											<p>Which of these is <strong>not true</strong> about condoms?</p>
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Carrying condoms is a sign of promiscuity &ndash; condoms should be kept discreetly at home by the bed.</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p>Having condoms on hand is a great idea! It makes it more likely you'll have one when you need it, or one you can offer to a friend when they need it. Keep a few condoms in your bag or car. Just be sure to check the expiry date and to replace them if they've expired or if they've been exposed to sun, heat or excessive friction.</p>
												</mcq-feedback>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Condoms come in different sizes &ndash; you should try out different types to find the right fit for you.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>It can take time to get comfortable using condoms &ndash; practising at home by yourself can boost your skills and confidence.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>You can't use oil-based lubricants with most types of condoms &ndash; it damages the material and they break.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Most condoms are made of latex &ndash; but there are other types you can use if you're allergic to latex.</mcq-answer>

							<p>Judgements and stigma can make it harder to look after your sexual health. For example, carrying condoms is a great way to be prepared, but if you're worried that people might judge you, then you might not do it.</p>
							<p>It's important to have accurate information about your sexual health risks, as well as the knowledge and skills to protect yourself and your sexual partners.</p>
							<p>Sex should be enjoyable, and worrying about the risks can take away from the fun. So protecting yourself can help you feel safer, more relaxed, and actually have better experiences.</p>
