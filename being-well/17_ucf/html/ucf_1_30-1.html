									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>Eligible Australian students and permanent residents who meet requirements can apply for a HELP loan, which is paid directly to your university. This is paid back once you are earning over a certain threshold.</p>

								<ladder-step>
									<ladder-label>Centrelink payments</ladder-label>
									<ladder-number>2</ladder-number>
									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>You might be able to get Centrelink student payments if your parents earn below a certain threshold, or you are an independent student. Services Australia will be able to advise on if you are eligible, and help you apply (see <em>'Useful links'</em> pod).</p>
									</ladder-feedback>

								<ladder-step>
									<ladder-label>Scholarships</ladder-label>
									<ladder-number>3</ladder-number>
									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>Eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students, both domestic and international, can receive a scholarship from the Australian Government to help with fees and living costs. An allowance for living costs is usually paid directly to you, and fees paid to the university. These scholarships are merit-based and awarded by individual universities. Universities will also have their own scholarships, and you should check with student support about what is available.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I work part-time to help support myself, as my Centrelink isn't quite enough. I work about 10 hours a week and more in the holidays. It's tough to manage my time but I'd have to work a lot more if I wasn't getting Centrelink as well.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>Although I get enough Centrelink each fortnight to cover my rent and other bills, there's not much left over, and in the past I had struggled at the beginning of each semester to afford textbooks. I got some help to budget this year, and so far I have been able to put some savings aside.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>Remember, you don't need to pay anything back on your HELP loan until you are earning over a set repayment threshold.</p>
							<p>We will look at repayments in more detail on the screen titled: <em>Loan repayments</em>, but first, there are few common misconceptions about student loans to investigate.</p>

									<p>None of these statements are true, but they are common things that you might have heard people say about your HELP loan, as you may see from other people's answers! In reality, the amount of HELP loan you have outstanding doesn't show up anywhere other than in your myGov account, which will show how much you owe and any repayments you have made. Although your HELP loan doesn't show on your credit file, home lenders may treat your repayments like any other liability and take this into account when assessing how much you can borrow. Also, your loan repayments are entirely based on your income, no one else's, so no one else can ever be asked to pay it for you. You do have to pay your loan back if you move overseas though &ndash; it's a common myth that you don't, but it's not true. The Australian Tax Office (ATO), which administers repayments, will look at how much you are earning overseas and calculate the minimum repayment threshold.</p>

							<p>It's completely normal to be worried about your HELP loan, but it's important to try and understand how different it is to other ways of borrowing money, and that the rate of repayment will be calculated on your earnings each year, rather than what you 'owe'.</p>
