							<p>Good study skills are often based on developing helpful habits, which we can repeat and embed in our daily lives. Successful study does not sit in isolation; the more we are able to take care of our mental health and physical wellbeing generally, the more able we will be to study successfully and reach our potential.</p>

							<p>Different things work for different people at different times. Developing a good routine for mental and physical wellbeing, as well as good study routines, is often a trial-and-error process. The build-up to exams and assessments can be particularly stressful. Good study strategies can help ease this phase.</p>

							<p>There are almost limitless ways of supporting yourself to develop good study routines. It's helpful to remember that effective and healthy study routines can play an important part in contributing to our positive sense of wellbeing, and vice versa.  Try not to compare yourself to others, as comparison is often highly subjective and typically incorrect. However, do use other people's good ideas and try them out for yourself, though be aware that what works for someone else might not work for you.</p>

										<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management approach that allows you to break down working time into smaller sections, with breaks, to help achieve greater focus and productivity.
