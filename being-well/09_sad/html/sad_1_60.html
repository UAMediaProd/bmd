									<p>Looking after a friend who needs help can be tiring. Help them find the right professional support if you can. Then you should step back and give yourself space to look after your own needs. Having sensible boundaries when we care for others is a good way of caring for ourselves at the same time.</p>
									<p>You don't have to take on someone else's worries, as well as your own. There are plenty of people in universities whose job it is to support you. Ask them for help when you need it.</p>

									<tab-content>
										<ul>
											<li>If you think you might need help, then you probably do.</li>
											<li>If you are not feeling or functioning well, or are in distress for more than a couple of weeks, seek help.</li>
											<li>The sooner you contact health professionals or support services (such as helplines) the sooner you can work towards a solution.</li>
											<li>Talk through your worries with a wellbeing professional or a tutor and see what they suggest. They are trained to support students in difficulty, so even if they can't help themselves, they will know someone who can.</li>
										</ul>
									</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Useful phrases</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<ul>
											<li>Make sure that there is time to have a proper conversation about your worries. Usually this means making an appointment to see someone like a GP or counsellor.</li>
											<li>Ask when the tutor is free to chat, or book an appointment with a GP or counsellor.</li>
											<li>Make a list of topics to cover, or feelings to mention, e.g. "I'm a bit worried about how I'm feeling at the moment/my wellbeing/my mental health. I wonder if you can help me?"</li>
											<li>Describe the things that have changed or have been worrying you ("I'm not sleeping/I've stopped being able to concentrate"). Be open to suggestions about actions to take, or therapy if you are speaking to a counsellor, psychologist or GP.</li>
											<li>Write down their comments so you can refer back to them later.</li>
										</ul>
									</tab-content>

									<tab-heading>Where to seek help</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<ul>
											<li>Universities are great at providing support to students and often provide more services than students realise (see the <em>'Your Context'</em> pod), so take the time to review the support options your university provides and pick the option you feel most comfortable with.</li>
											<li>If you have a regular GP or have seen one previously you felt comfortable with, then book an appointment appointment to talk about your wellbeing.</li>
											<li>In most universities there are other professionals that you can talk to: counsellors, disability advisors, chaplains, student wellbeing ambassadors, mentors etc. You might even feel comfortable speaking to a topic or course coordinator. These can be good starting points for addressing what is troubling you.</li>
											<li>There are also typically health and mental health services in the wider community that you can use. These might be recommended to you by university staff, or you might need to do some independent research to find out what health and wellbeing services are in your area.</li>
										</ul>
									</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>What support you might expect</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<ul>
											<li>University staff can help with a range of support.</li>
											<li>Academic staff can sometimes make academic allowances such as deadline extensions.</li>
											<li>Professional staff (e.g. counsellors, disability advisors and international student advisors) can sometimes write letters of support for visa, academic or other requirements.</li>
											<li>Counsellors can provide short-term therapy and advice on academic matters.</li>
											<li>Library and student academic support staff can help you with aspects of studying that you are finding stressful (e.g. essay writing, referencing, researching, etc.).</li>
											<li>University health staff can provide medical care.</li>
											<li>Even if they can't provide direct help, staff can provide non-judgemental generic advice and alert you to services you may not have been aware of.</li>
											<li>Peer support is another option, often via the students' association, or from trained student mentors.</li>
										</ul>

								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Medication and therapy options</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<ul>
											<li>Once you have connected with a health or mental health service, you may be offered a variety of treatment options.</li>
											<li>Give all of the options consideration.</li>
											<li>You won't be 'made to' follow any of them, but they are discussed with you so that you are part of any decision-making process.</li>
											<li>Medication can be very helpful for certain issues, but should only be taken under the expert guidance of a qualified professional.</li>
											<li>There are many varieties of counselling or talking therapies available, and it is important to discuss these options with a professional.</li>
											<li>If you feel like the first type of therapy isn't right for you, feel free to 'shop around' and try other varieties &ndash; it's important to find a professional that you feel you can connect with and trust.</li>
										</ul>
									</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Support from friends and family</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<ul>
											<li>Family or friends can be a great source of support.</li>
											<li>If you believe they would be supportive, talk to them if you are feeling stressed or low.</li>
											<li>However, not everyone's family understands about wellbeing issues, or mental health, so you may prefer to talk to another trusted person outside of your family.</li>
											<li>Coming to university can be a turning point in realising that people sometimes need support. </li>
											<li>When life is challenging, there is nothing to feel guilty or a failure about.</li>
											<li>When we need a helping hand, family can play an important role in helping us to recover.</li>

							<h3>What might stop us asking for help</h3>

							<p>It can be helpful to acknowledge that sometimes there are things that stop us from asking for support, even if we want to. These 'barriers' may include things that we have not yet recognised, or they may be very obvious. How can you overcome these barriers?</p>

This is when they are treated unfairly because of their symptoms or diagnoses. They might be thought of as 'weak' or told to "get over it". Sometimes people believe those things about themselves when they are unable to cope or suffering from anxiety. Stigma can stop people seeking help and can lead to people being excluded from participating fully in social and other activities. Stigma around mental health problems or emotional issues is reducing, but some people are still unaware of how their unsupportive views can affect you. If you need help, think carefully about who you can talk to that you trust. You are not overreacting.</p></mcq-feedback>

Perhaps we have never realised that mental health (like physical health) needs to be cared for, or that it can be helped if we are not coping as well as we would like to be. Arriving at university, it is normal to want to be independent of family. You may feel that asking for help would be like admitting failure. However, it is always the right thing to do if you are struggling to manage on your own. If a relative or friend is struggling, reaching out to them may be the best thing you can do.</p></mcq-feedback>

												<mcq-feedback><p>Life is so hectic, especially at university, and it can be very difficult to find the time to get help when you need it. But making time for yourself is crucial. If you need help it may be easiest to go online first and contact services through their website or call a helpline. You might want to read about your concerns before going to the appointment, so that you feel better informed and prepared. There are multiple online options for delivering support, which many universities provide free to their students. Check out which apps and online services your university makes available for wellbeing, as this may save you time when getting advice and support.</p></mcq-feedback>

												<mcq-feedback><p>We don't always recognise when we need help, or we may think that we should be able to manage without anyone else's support. You may blame yourself for your feelings or situation, and not think that you deserve help. There are many reasons why our own beliefs (and sometimes self-critical views) can stop us getting the help we need. Try instead to be compassionate towards yourself and treat yourself as you would a friend. You would not tell someone you care about that they don't deserve help. So why not be kinder to yourself? Take a moment to reflect on if you are ever too tough on yourself, consider what you could do to be kinder to yourself and take a step towards asking for support. Self-blame is explored further in the modules titled: <em>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience</em>, and <em>Am I good enough?</em></p></mcq-feedback>

												<mcq-feedback><p>Going to see a professional can be intimidating and stressful. You may worry that they will not be understanding, or compassionate. You may feel that they will dismiss your worries, or will be too busy to listen. It is not unreasonable to consider how a stranger (though they might be trained to support students) might react to you, but you can reduce the risk of a bad experience. Try talking with the professional about something more minor first and see how they react. This can build your confidence to talk to them about more difficult topics. If you have had a previous bad experience seeking help, try to put this out of your mind and start afresh with a new person. Professionals are trained to help students and that is their job; students who ask for help are not wasting anyone's time.</p></mcq-feedback>

												<mcq-answer>Career concerns</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback><p>Students worry about how their mental health and wellbeing issues might affect them when applying for jobs, or in the future workplace. They worry about fitness to practise in certain vocational careers, or about disclosure of health issues for others. The reality is that the workplace is becoming much more supportive in general, especially for wellbeing issues. Many employers now provide lots of wellbeing initiatives. It is also considered better to acknowledge that one has issues and to seek help or treatment, rather than to hide those issues away. If you are worried about potential career impact then discuss your personal situation with the careers service and your GP, or academic department. The world is changing and you may be pleasantly surprised by the advice and information that you discover. Remember, confidentiality is taken extremely seriously by universities, the health services and employers, so your information will not be shared without your permission.</p></mcq-feedback>

								</ul>
								<p><strong>The correct answer is:</strong> Time pressures</p>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>Life is so hectic, especially at university, and it can be very difficult to find the time to get help when you need it. But making time for yourself is crucial. If you need help it may be easiest to go online first and contact services through their website or call a helpline. You might want to read about your concerns before going to the appointment, so that you feel better informed and prepared. There are multiple online options for delivering support, which many universities provide free to their students. Check out which apps and online services your university makes available for wellbeing, as this may save you time when getting advice and support.</p>

								<h4>Scenario 4:</h4>
								<p>Harriet has low confidence and feels that she isn't good enough.</p>
								<p>"I've always wanted to study for a Master's and, now I'm finally here, I'm finding it much more difficult than I anticipated. I'm letting myself down and feel stupid for not being able to keep up with the others. I often wonder why I even bother trying when I'm clearly not good enough."</p>
								<h4>Question:</h4>
								<p>What barrier is Harriet dealing with?</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Self-criticism</li>
									<li>Cultural issues</li>
									<li>Fear of being prescribed medication</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>The correct answer is:</strong> Self-criticism</p>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>We don't always recognise when we need help, or we may think that we should be able to manage without anyone else's support. You may blame yourself for your feelings or situation, and not think that you deserve help. There are many reasons why our own beliefs (and sometimes self-critical views) can stop us getting the help we need. Try instead to be compassionate towards yourself and treat yourself as you would a friend. You would not tell someone you care about that they don't deserve help. So why not be kinder to yourself? Take a moment to reflect on if you are ever too tough on yourself, consider what you could do to be kinder to yourself and take a step towards asking for support. Self-blame is explored further in the modules titled: <em>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience</em>, and <em>Am I good enough?</em></p>

								<h4>Scenario 5:</h4>
								<p>Andy is reluctant to talk to a professional about his issues.</p>
								<p>"I've been suffering with low mood lately and my housemate noticed and spoke with me about it. She suggested I go and speak to a counsellor, but I'm a very private person and I can't imagine sharing how I feel with a complete stranger &ndash; the conversation with my friend was excruciating enough!"</p>
								<h4>Question:</h4>
								<p>What barrier is Andy dealing with?</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Financial costs</li>
									<li>Worries about talking to professionals</li>
									<li>Fear no one will take him seriously</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>The correct answer is:</strong> Worries about talking to professionals</p>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>Going to see a professional can be intimidating and stressful. You may worry that they will not be understanding, or compassionate. You may feel that they will dismiss your worries, or will be too busy to listen. It is not unreasonable to consider how a stranger (though they might be trained to support students) might react to you, but you can reduce the risk of a bad experience. Try talking with the professional about something more minor first and see how they react. This can build your confidence to talk to them about more difficult topics. If you have had a previous bad experience seeking help, try to put this out of your mind and start afresh with a new person. Professionals are trained to help students and that is their job; students who ask for help are not wasting anyone's time.</p>

								<h4>Scenario 6:</h4>
								<p>Josie is worried about employers finding out that she has sought help.</p>
								<p>"I've been feeling really anxious recently and keep thinking something terrible is about to happen. It's affecting my day-to-day life &ndash; for example, I'm worried about taking public transport, which has never bothered me before.  I feel like I want to talk to someone about it, but I'm worried that it might hamper my prospects of getting on a good grad scheme &ndash; the competition is tough enough and I don't want them to think I won't be able to cope."</p>
								<h4>Question:</h4>
								<p>What barrier is Josie dealing with?</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Time barriers</li>
									<li>Career concerns</li>
									<li>Cultural issues</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>The correct answer is:</strong> Career concerns</p>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>Students worry about how their mental health and wellbeing issues might affect them when applying for jobs, or in the future workplace. They worry about fitness to practise in certain vocational careers, or about disclosure of health issues for others. The reality is that the workplace is becoming much more supportive in general, especially for wellbeing issues. Many employers now provide lots of wellbeing initiatives. It is also considered better to acknowledge that one has issues and to seek help or treatment, rather than to hide those issues away. If you are worried about potential career impact then discuss your personal situation with the careers service and your GP, or academic department. The world is changing and you may be pleasantly surprised by the advice and information that you discover. Remember, confidentiality is taken extremely seriously by universities, the health services and employers, so your information will not be shared without your permission.</p>

							<p>We have looked at when, where and how to ask for help if you are struggling with stress, anxiety or depression. You should be feeling reassured that it is common for students to feel stressed, but that if feelings are becoming overwhelming or unrelenting then it is best to ask for help from a trusted professional, or friend or family member.</p>
							<p>If you are keen to be proactive in your self-care, and want to take steps to look after your wellbeing, we encourage you to make your action plan (on the <em>Action plan</em> screen). You can use some of the ideas that you have read about in this module and also get creative and make it work for you!</p>
