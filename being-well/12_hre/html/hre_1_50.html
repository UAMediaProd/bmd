							<p>Knowing that you can get help &ndash; whatever your role in an unhealthy relationship &ndash; is really important. Getting support doesn't have to mean walking away from a friend or partner; support can mean forging a healthy way forward together. Support services can help to establish and understand boundaries to create more positive dynamics between friends, partners and family members.</p>

									<tab-content>
										<p>If you are feeling uncomfortable with something or feel under pressure from someone, this is a small alarm ringing to say it's time to reach out and ask for some help.</p>
										<p>Support can help you:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Understand boundaries and how to communicate them</li>
											<li>Identify and change unhealthy friendship or partner dynamics</li>
											<li>Build confidence and positive relationships moving forward.</li>
										</ul>

								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Supporter</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>Supporting someone through unhealthy friendships or intimate relationships can be hard emotional work, and as a supporter you always want to be sure you are a positive influence or giving correct information. This is where seeking help yourself is essential. Whether it is professional assistance or ensuring some self-care, you can't help others if you aren't looking after yourself.</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Bystander</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>Seeing something upsetting unfold, or stepping in to say something in a situation can be stressful, and play on your mind long after the event. If you find that you are replaying situations or wondering if you should or could have done things differently, these are signs you may need to talk to someone. Seeking support will help you to unpack these questions and allow you to feel more confident as a positive bystander in the future.</tab-content>
								</tab-item>
								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Person causing discomfort or harm</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>If you connect with some of our examples of unhealthy behaviour, or suspect some of the things you do might not make people around you feel great, you can get help. People who are inexperienced with friendships or intimate relationships often unknowingly perpetrate bad behaviour because they don't know better ways to treat people, perhaps because of negative role models or no one telling them their behaviour is hurtful. No one should judge you or put you down, and people who care for you want you to be the best version of yourself you can be. But it rests with you to take that first step. Do it now and you won't regret it! </tab-content>

									<pod-quote><p>No one wants to be a bad friend or a bad boyfriend but sometimes you don't know what you are doing is wrong. Get help! Get advice! That's all I can say.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Kane, 25</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I heard a mental health talk where the guy talked about getting help to change negative behaviours. I realised that was me he was talking about. I was embarrassed and I still didn't believe I had a problem. But I talked it through on a free telephone service he recommended and then went and saw someone. It changed my life. I'm not a bully to my friends anymore and I'm a better partner when I am in a relationship.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Michael, 27</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I look forward to going to counselling now. It's like my check-in with myself. One month I went and all I said was how great I felt I was doing, and how on top of things I was. Things were still hard but I was aware and managing. Best session ever!</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Ali, 18</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>Trying to get my friend out of an abusive relationship was the hardest thing I've ever done. She knew it was bad, but she just wouldn't leave. It took me a long time to realise that she didn't think she had any power or choice. I screamed at her once to leave but she just couldn't. I'm glad I stood by her but I understand why some of our friends gave up on her. She did finally leave but she lost heaps of friends because of it.</p></pod-quote>
