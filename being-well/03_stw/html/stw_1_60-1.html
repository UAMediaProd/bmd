							<p>A focused approach to how we study sets the right foundations in place for a range of tasks, including self-directed study, working in groups, delivering presentations and preparing for assessments and examinations. Many problems can be headed off, or solved, with the right toolkit in place. However, it is important to make use of university resources when needed to help review your progress and learn new strategies.</p>

							<!-- ACTIVITY START -->
							<checklist>
								<check-item>Developing effective study routines is like building a house: getting the foundations right will be critical in everything else that comes after</check-item>
								<check-item>Reflecting on what works for you, and what has been problematic in the past, will be a good start for thinking about how you want to study now</check-item>
								<check-item>It is important to pay attention to procrastination and consider what it is that you are really trying to avoid. Dealing with the problem is the most important step in dealing with procrastination</check-item>
								<check-item>Different things work for different people in getting studying right &ndash; trial and error, and learning from your mistakes is a good way of developing effective routines</check-item>
								<check-item>Looking after your physical and emotional wellbeing creates the right context for you to be able to perform effectively</check-item>
								<check-item>Don't forget the practical things you can do to make a difference, such as considering where you work, or how long you work for</check-item>
								<check-item>The most common mistake is throwing more time at work as a way of dealing with anxiety. Working smartly is more important than spending hours at the same task.</check-item>
							</checklist>
							<!-- ACTIVITY END -->

							<p>Remember that your university will have a range of different resources available to help you study well, as well as being able to share tips for making improvements to routines. Never be afraid to ask for support or help if you are struggling.</p>
