							<p>As we have discovered, eating healthily is important. However, healthy attitudes to eating are important as well. The term 'healthy attitudes' means that eating and food are just one part of life. Food is not an obsession or something that worries you all the time. It means that:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>You treat food and eating as something enjoyable </li>
									<li>Your food intake varies, and you may eat less on some days and more on others</li>
									<li>You don't have strict rules or judgements around food or cut out foods or food groups (unless for a specific reason, e.g. intolerance, religious, cultural or ethical reasons)</li>
									<li>You don't track your food intake obsessively</li>
									<li>You don't diet in a way that is compulsive or regularly skip meals </li>
									<li>You enjoy some foods more than others just because you prefer the taste.</li>
								</ul>
							</text-block>

							<p>How would you describe your attitude to food?</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Reflect on your relationship with food by responding to each of the questions.</p></instructional-text>

								<process-page>
									<text-entry>Choose a few words to describe your usual relationship with food. For example, what does food signify for you? Is it fuel for the body? When and how do you usually eat? Is it when you're hungry?</text-entry>

							<p>Thinking that you, a friend or a loved one may have serious issues with food, or disordered eating (e.g. restricting food intake, regularly overeating, having unrealistic or obsessive food rules), is challenging. However, it is important to discuss your concerns with someone you trust. If you are unsure who to turn to, your GP is a good place to start. There are also many online or telephone support services available, if this feels more comfortable. Talking about these issues is a first great step in the right direction (see the <em>'Your context'</em> pod for details). Help and support are available to you, no matter what you are going through.</p>

									<p>If you think that you, a friend or a loved one may have serious issues with food, it's important to reach out for support. Consider contacting your university support services, your GP or the Butterfly Foundation national support line on <strong>1800 ED HOPE</strong>.</p>
