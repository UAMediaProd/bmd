							<p>While higher education can bring with it enormous benefits and opportunities, it's not uncommon for students to encounter study stress at some stage of their course of study. The type of trigger for such stress, and the time it may happen, can vary enormously for each student. For some, it may be focused around examination or assessment times. Or, it might be at the end of semester when people head off in their separate directions or spend time studying away from university, perhaps in a different part of the country or abroad.</p>

							<p>As we have learnt from the student interviews, stress can be caused by a variety of things and can impact us in all sorts of ways. It is important to acknowledge that stress is not necessarily negative; it can help focus our attention and can contribute to us performing to our best, or producing high-quality work. However, stress that continues for too long may lead to problematic anxiety, or begin to contribute to physical health conditions and undermine our emotional wellbeing.</p>

							<p>If you regularly feel very stressed whilst studying, book an appointment with student services. They will be able to help you put strategies in place that work for you, and make studying feel more manageable. Stress is explored more thoroughly in the module titled: <em>Stress, anxiety and depression.</em></p>
