										<node-heading>University bursaries and scholarships</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Check with your university about what they offer in additional financial support. If you are eligible for a bursary or scholarship, do you need to apply for it? When will you receive this support, and how will it be paid?</p>

										<node-heading>Funding from other sources</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Many charities, trusts and other organisations have funds for students in education. Your local community may have funds available, so check what is possible. International students can access scholarships from their home nation, as well as Australia. If you are employed, make sure you ask your employer about sponsorship schemes.</p>

										<node-heading>Help from people you know and savings</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>You may be lucky enough to be able to rely on help from others, but check how much this will be, and which costs you are going to have to cover yourself. If you can save some money before you start university, this can be helpful. If you already have savings, are you willing to tap into these if the going gets tough?</p>

										<node-content>
											<p>Working part-time, selling items like old tech or clothes, babysitting, taking online surveys, and blogging &ndash; these are all things that students have done in order to supplement their income. Think about things that could enhance your CV as well as your bank balance, but always put your wellbeing first.</p>

								<h4>Question 1 of 5:</h4>

								<h4>Question 4 of 5:</h4>
								<p>You can just about cover everything if you keep to a tight budget and work alongside study, but what happens if you lose your job or something unexpected happens?</p>
								<h4>Hint:</h4>
								<p>Do you have any funds to fall back on in an emergency or someone who could help if the need arose? Will you need an overdraft facility on your bank account? Does your university have a hardship fund?</p>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>Life has a habit of moving in ways we don't expect, so having a fall-back plan is helpful. Student bank accounts have fee- and interest-free overdraft facilities which can provide a safety net when things don't go to plan, but don't be tempted to see your overdraft as extra cash. If you can see that finances are going to be difficult, speak to your university about hardship funds and who is eligible to apply. Don't be afraid to ask for budgeting and money advice from student services.</p>
