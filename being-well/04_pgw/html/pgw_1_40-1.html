							<p>'Imposter syndrome' or 'imposter phenomenon' describes the thought process where someone has a fear of 'being found out', because they are unable to see their own achievements in a realistic light.</p>
							<p>John Gravois stated that "Academics &ndash; graduate students, junior professors, and even some full professors &ndash; relate to this only a little less than they relate to eye strain" (Gravois, J. 2007), and over 70% of all people are estimated to have at least one episode of imposter syndrome during their lifetime.</p>
							<p>Researchers can sometimes feel like they don't belong or aren't worthy to present knowledge during their studies. Postgraduate researchers may be more susceptible to imposter syndrome because they are in an environment where the expectations are around generating new knowledge and presenting findings for critique to other academics &ndash; many of whom may be much more experienced. This raises a researcher's profile quickly, and it can feel intimidating and pressured, even for people who are generally confident in their abilities.</p>

										<p><strong>John:</strong> How are you getting on with the archive research you were talking about last time?</p>
										<p><strong>Anika:</strong> To be honest, I'm finding it difficult at the moment &ndash; my mum's been really sick and I've had to go back home to help my dad out and I haven't found my supervisor to be particularly sympathetic.</p>

							<p>At the root of imposter syndrome is the 'inner critic'. This is the voice in your head that tells you what you should and shouldn't be doing and has the ability to constantly make you feel inadequate. This voice belongs to you and it is therefore possible to challenge it and bring it under control. The first stage is to notice it, and then to identify actions to take to generate more positive thoughts.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I spent a lot of my first year thinking that perhaps I wasn't really capable of the level of original thought necessary to get a PhD. Everyone around me just seemed to be so much more intelligent and articulate &ndash; I felt like a real blunderer by comparison! I spoke to another HDR student who was near the end of her thesis, and she said that it's really common to feel like that and most people doing PhDs think like it at some point. I was really surprised that even she'd doubted her abilities in her second year and that she was really nervous about her examination. I realised that it's actually part of the learning process &ndash; you're not learning if you know everything when you start!</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Daniella, 36</em></p>
									<pod-quote><p>When I run into feelings of self-doubt around my PhD, I try to take some space and reconnect with why I started it in the first place. I think about the journey I've been on to get to where I am, including all the work I've done for my undergraduate and Master's degrees. I remind myself that it took me a while to learn the skills required for those too &ndash; I wasn't perfect at them right away. I also remind myself that I chose my research topic for a reason, because it's important to me and I think it's going to make a difference in society. Reflecting like this really helps me remember my strengths and reconnect with my ambitions. Postgraduate study is challenging, but if you keep putting one foot in front of the other and progressing the best you can, you'll be OK.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>It often helps to know that other students are feeling the same way &ndash; your university may run personal and professional development courses for postgraduate researchers, and on these courses you will meet lots of other students who are feeling the same way. Once you realise that you are really not alone, it becomes easier to deal with this inner critic. The inner critic is likely to be with you for the rest of your life, so it helps to learn skills to deal with it now. This will also help in reducing isolation and anxiety and improving self-confidence, which can have long-term knock-on benefits and enhance other areas of your life too!</p>
