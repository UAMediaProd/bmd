							<p>Community is at the heart of university life &ndash; both the university community as a whole and the many smaller groups that make it up: course members, seminars, societies, faith groups, and shared living arrangements. Every student will eventually find their place or places to 'belong'.</p>

									<p><text-quote>At first I thought I would really stand out, but actually I feel just like any other student most of the time. Joining the Music Society really helped &ndash; they are a friendly bunch, and you don't already have to be able to play or sing to join. It's just a nice thing to do in the evenings, and then we go out for a drink or a coffee afterwards. I'm learning the ukulele, and I never thought that would happen! People do make assumptions at first, like asking me when I am going home for the weekend, but I just tell them my background, and then they understand. I also do some volunteering through the students' association &ndash; we go and clear overgrown gardens, that sort of thing. It's fun and you meet lots of new people. I like my course, but these groups really make me feel part of things.</text-quote></p>

									<p><text-quote>I was really worried about how the family would manage when I came to university &ndash; I didn't have time to think about what it would be like for me to be here! But actually it's been great. My brother and sister have stepped up, and my housemates know that I go home at the weekends. It means I work hard during the week and don't go out as much as the others &ndash; but I'm in a great study group and we have a fun time. We chat over WhatsApp a lot and that means I can feel part of it even when I'm not there.</text-quote></p>

									<p><text-quote>I really wanted to come to university so I could study Art. I contacted the uni's disability service before university began and that really helped me to understand what support was in place for my specific needs. I get support from the equitable learning team and that is helpful. I like the quiz nights in the pub and go most weeks. I joined the Astronomical Society &ndash; I like the warm atmosphere, and have made friends there. I know the quiet places in the university and use the library a lot. I feel I belong to the whole institution, not just to one part of it, and I can choose the bits that work best for me.</text-quote></p>

									<p><text-quote>Coming to a foreign university was always my ambition. I knew it would be a challenge, and I certainly did miss my family and friends from home a lot at first. One of the ways I made friends here was through the International Students Society, and also through the Islamic Society. These gave me somewhere immediate to belong. I had to push myself to go to those first meetings, but am glad that I did, as it gave me the confidence to keep trying new things. People do have preconceptions about my country, but I enjoy talking to them about the reality of living in Islamabad, which is a city with a rich cultural history. I feel I open their eyes sometimes! Students are the same underneath, really &ndash; we all want to do well and make friends along the way. For me, it's not bars and clubs so much as activities &ndash; I have joined a running group and may take up Judo. It keeps me fit and helps me to meet different people.</text-quote></p>

								<opinion name="Stephen is an Aboriginal student from South-Coast NSW, living away from his community and studying Engineering." img-src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/424/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/slb_1_30_img5_aus.png" img-alt="Male, black, 20 years old, wearing a T-Shirt">
									<p><text-quote>I'm from Worimi country in New South Wales. Coming to a large university, I had some concerns about not fitting in and living away from my family and community. I am in a minority, and in some ways I was right to be cautious. I have always identified as Aboriginal but, due to the lighter colour of my skin, people are always asking me what percentage I am, and that includes some of the staff... My heritage is important to me, but that's something more than skin colour! But people here are open to learning and it's good to talk through cultural assumptions, even though it's a burden for me as a young person. It's helped to make friends through the Indigenous Centre and to meet Elders by attending cultural events. It's been great to connect with other Indigenous students and I think we were all happy to find each other &ndash; it's like having a home base. I've also made good friends through my flat, which is really mixed &ndash; there is someone from Iran and someone with cerebral palsy, which was new to my experience. This isn't home and that isn't easy at times, but I am glad I came here &ndash; I like the people, the course and the community here.</text-quote></p>

								<opinion name="Annie's home is only 30 miles away, but she lives on campus to be close to the medical school. " img-src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/424/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/slb_1_30_img6_aus.png" img-alt="Female, Latina , long hair tied back and wearing a sweatshirt">
									<p><text-quote>Being a medical student is really busy &ndash; there's a lot of work to do. This means I spend most of my time with other students on my course or the ones I live with. In the flat we often cook together and share some evenings watching movies. That makes it cheaper too &ndash; less eating out and you can double up eating with socialising! On the course we study a lot together and encourage each other to keep going even when it's tough &ndash; it's great to have someone just say, "You can do it" when you've lost the plot! On the weekends I have at least one day off and I often go home and take a friend with me &ndash; we walk the dog or something. It's nice to mix my home and university life, it makes me feel like I join up and can have a foot in both places.</text-quote></p>

								<any-category-answers>							
									<classify-item>Clubs and societies give you a common interest as a starting point to meet people. It can take courage to turn up to the first one, but you'll soon start to feel comfortable, and there are usually lots of 'taster sessions' for newcomers. If you like keeping fit, you can often double this up with belonging to a sports club, or joining the gym and its classes. 
									<classify-item-short>Clubs and societies, sport and fitness</classify-item-short>
									</classify-item>
									<classify-item>Volunteering can be a really good way to meet like-minded people while doing something useful. You can choose an activity that suits you, from carol singing in an old people's home to being an ambassador for the university. It can be good for your CV too. 
										<classify-item-short>Volunteering</classify-item-short>
									</classify-item>
									<classify-item>If you live in shared accommodation, it can be fun to spend time with your housemates. Simple things like eating together, or having a games night, can make a big difference. Sometimes it just takes someone to suggest it!
										<classify-item-short>Building community with housemates</classify-item-short>
									</classify-item>
									<classify-item>You spend a lot of time with your course mates and you all have something in common &ndash; the subject. Studying together can be a great way to get to know each other. It can be as simple as suggesting that you go for coffee together after class, or joining the appropriate groups on social media.
										<classify-item-short>Building community with course mates</classify-item-short>
									</classify-item>
									<classify-item>All universities have some faith-based groups where you can find a space to express your beliefs and practise your faith. There are often specific spaces like chapels and prayer rooms, or multi-purpose spaces. And not everything will be specifically religious &ndash; for example, meditation is for everyone.
										<classify-item-short>Faith-based activities</classify-item-short>
									</classify-item>
									<classify-item>Some students like going to nightclubs, but they are not for everyone, and are often where you go with your friends, rather than to make friends. But it can be good fun to let off steam in the safety of a student night at a local pub, or at student-run parties on campus.

							<p>Feeling that you belong at university is important. It can take time and energy to find the activities and groups that you feel bring out the best in you, but it is well worth the effort. If you are stuck, talk to your students' association or student support services &ndash; they will be able to offer advice. The module titled: <em>Your student journey</em> also looks at the idea of finding where you belong at university.</p>
