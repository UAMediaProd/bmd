							<p>The terms 'self-harm' and 'suicide' are used regularly in the media, in support information, by professionals and, increasingly, in our everyday language. While it can be easy to imagine that self-harm and suicidal thoughts are very rare occurrences, the reality is that they are more common than some would imagine. Anyone might potentially have thoughts about self&ndash;harm and suicide, including those around us &ndash; friends, family and, of course, ourselves too. Realising this can help people talk about their feelings and receive the right sort of support.</p>

							<p>We can see from Khalida's, Matty's and Charlotte's stories that self-harm, suicidal feelings or being worried about a friend can impact on us in different ways. Khalida doesn't know how best to cope with her feelings, which, at times, are overwhelming for her. Matty can get into a place of crisis where he feels his life is no longer worth living, but also notices how differently he can feel later. Charlotte was worried about a friend and, having taken the step to ask, found that making a connection with someone could really make a difference.</p>
							<p>The overall message is that such thoughts are often transitory, and talking to someone else can really help.</p>

										<mcq-question><p>What is the most likely outcome of sensitively asking someone if they have suicidal thoughts?</p></mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>If they did not have suicidal thoughts, it could put the thought in their mind.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>You will never get an accurate or honest answer.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>They will feel embarrassed and not talk to you about their problems again.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Even if they don't answer the question immediately, having been asked will be experienced as support and will promote future positive help-seeking.</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>It is a common myth that asking about suicide increases the risk. There is no evidence for this. Whereas, asking about suicide, even if the person does not feel able to answer honestly at that point, will communicate that it is OK to talk about and will encourage them to trust you more, or to seek positive support elsewhere. Hearing that someone has suicidal thoughts can be upsetting; it is important not to promise to keep such information confidential as helping the person find the right source of support will be critical. Additionally, it is important to find support for yourself if you feel affected by what has happened.</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question><p>What might be the reasons why people self-harm?</p></mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>To get attention.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>To end their own life.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>To cope with difficult feelings, or situations.</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>Although there are lots of reasons for people to self-harm, typically it is to cope with very difficult feelings or situations. We can all self-harm at times of difficulty when our other coping strategies do not feel adequate. For some these behaviours can be the only thing they know that helps (which is why seeking support can be important in finding alternative less self-destructive strategies), whereas for others the habit of self-harming can, itself, be soothing. For most people who self-harm, making someone else feel bad is not the primary motivation, but there are occasions when someone might threaten to hurt themselves or attempt suicide in order to exercise control or manipulate someone else. It is important not to take responsibility for someone else's safety and to seek help at such times.</mcq-feedback>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Because they want to make someone else feel bad.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
