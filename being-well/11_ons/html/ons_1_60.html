							<p>Online harassment is repeated contact targeted at an individual that causes them substantial emotional distress and/or the fear of harm. This might include, among other things, repeated persistent calling or messaging, repeated abusive emails, and posts on social media targeting the individual. </p>
							<p>Sometimes cyberstalking can also be involved in harassment, where a perpetrator uses data collected online to see where someone is or discover information about their life. </p>

One night I was drunk and still fuming about it all, and was seriously considering posting some naked photos I had of him online to teach him a lesson. I'm embarrassed I had those thoughts, and thankfully my friend talked me down and told me it was illegal and I'd make an idiot of myself too. I'm so glad I listened and I've since deleted all those photos. I'd be horrified if something like that happened to me.</p></pod-quote>

I told her that she needed to trust me, and that I found it controlling that she wanted to see it. She apologised for making me feel that way and it hasn't been brought up again.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>After we split up, my ex kept on texting me and messaging me on social media. I tried to block them but they would go through friends to see what I was up to. Eventually it stopped, but it was scary at the time and I wish I'd known how to report it.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>There are things you can do to protect yourself from this sort of abuse. While some activities are straightforward, such as good password management and preventing access to your devices, you can also use techniques like blocking to prevent someone from contacting you.</p>

									<node-content>There are a number of things you can do to manage your privacy and protect yourself from online harassment.</node-content>
								</central-concept>
								<concept-nodes>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Keeping devices safe</node-heading>
										<node-content>Ensure you do not allow others to have access to mobile device, laptops, etc. As well as being able to change passwords and extract personal data and media, they might install software or apps that allow them to monitor your devices or track you without you knowing.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Log out!</node-heading>
										<node-content>On shared devices (for example university computers or laptops) always make sure you log out of things like social media and put on password-protected screensavers if you leave the device unattended. </node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Online calendars</node-heading>
										<node-content>Online calendars can be a great way of keeping yourself organised but be careful with your login details or with whom you share them. Calendars are a great way for a potential stalker to work out where you are. </node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Collect evidence</node-heading>
										<node-content>If someone is sending you repeated messages, calling several times over a short period of time, or posting abusive comments about you online, do not respond but screenshot everything. It is difficult for the other person to claim they are innocent if there is clear evidence to show the harassment.
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Tracking</node-heading>
										<node-content>Switch off GPS tracking features on your devices, especially if you think someone might have accessed your phone. Remember that mobile phone cameras can add location data to photographs, so be sure to switch those features off too.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Blocking </node-heading>
										<node-content>If someone is harassing you online or on your mobile device, block them. Most social media apps provide you with the means to block people, as do mobile devices. Blocking will stop them from being able to send you messages, and also stop them seeing what you are posting online. </node-content>

							<p>While some of these behaviours in isolation might not seem to be too bad, constant and persistent messaging, comments on social media, demands to see your devices and wanting access to your information are forms of harassment, which can be extremely upsetting and can have a negative impact upon mental health. So don't be afraid to block and report. If you are concerned for your wellbeing or feel you are at risk of harm, then go to the police and make use of support from your university to address the impact on your wellbeing. </p>
