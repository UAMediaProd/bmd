							<p>Often, it is the thought that no one else feels like us that is the biggest barrier to talking to someone. Staff in student services will not make a judgement about you if you have challenging thoughts, and will ensure you have time to talk and the opportunity to build strategies for self-support.</p>

							<!-- ACTIVITY START -->
							<checklist>
								<check-item>Self-harm is when we do something to harm ourselves, often as a means of coping with overwhelming feelings</check-item>
								<check-item>The thought of self-harm can build up over a longer period of time &ndash; days or weeks &ndash; or can happen quickly &ndash; over a few hours, or less</check-item>
								<check-item>Suicidal thoughts can include thoughts that only last a short period of time, through to strong and intense thoughts with a plan</check-item>
								<check-item>Sometimes suicidal thoughts can happen quickly &ndash; or impulsively &ndash; with little warning</check-item>
								<check-item>Most people who have suicidal thoughts do not want to die, but do not know how to live and cope with their feelings</check-item>
								<check-item>Fearing being judged or making people angry can be the biggest barriers to seeking help</check-item>
								<check-item>There are lots of self-help strategies for self-harm and suicidal thoughts that can really make a big difference</check-item>
								<check-item>A safety plan can be one of the biggest and most positive things to do to create a supportive resource in times of difficulty</check-item>
								<check-item>Talking with a trained person can make a huge difference and can help break the cycle of self-harm, or deal with suicidal thinking.</check-item>
							</checklist>

							<p>It is important to remember that there is hope and even the most difficult thoughts can be changed for the better.</p>
