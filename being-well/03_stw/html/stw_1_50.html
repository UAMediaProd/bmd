							<p>When things aren't going according to plan, there are lots of ways your university can offer you support. Too many students don't use these systems because they feel that they should be able to cope alone. Nothing could be further from the truth; no one would or should judge you for a situation you have found yourself in and which isn't in your control. Similarly, no one would or should judge you for seeking help if you are struggling with academic pressure, even if you don't have a diagnosed mental health disorder.</p>
							<p>Different universities might have slightly different processes or different systems supporting these processes or, indeed, different names for similar processes.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I had been struggling for a while with my feelings following a bereavement and was overwhelmed by the looming deadlines.  It was so useful to speak to my tutor as I was able to apply for an extension, which took the pressure off and really made a positive difference in helping me to cope with the challenges I was facing.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I had thought about taking an internship for a year but was anxious about doing so.  Talking to staff in my faculty, and other students, really gave me the confidence to do it, and they were even able to help with the application. I'm glad I put myself forward for the opportunity, and I gained so much from it.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Marianne, 28</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I found some of my study tasks to be a challenge as I've been blind in one eye since birth. This affects my balance and freedom of movement, and means I'm often extremely tired as I need to focus so hard on everything. I spoke to the disability team and they were really helpful. The university has been able to make 'reasonable adjustments', meaning that deadlines and where I do exams, for example, have already been sorted for me. It has taken off so much pressure.</p></pod-quote>

											<ul>
												<li>'Extenuating circumstances' &ndash; or 'mitigating circumstances' &ndash; refers to a situation where something has happened outside of your control that has directly impacted on your capacity to study. It could be physical ill health, bereavement or a mental health problem, such as problematic anxiety or depression</li>
												<li>It allows the university to consider these circumstances to ensure you are not prejudiced in an assessment. Such considerations are typically undertaken by the head of school staff and your lecturer, and personal information is not routinely shared beyond that</li>

							<p>As well as student services, there are often other sources of support available at universities, such as pastoral support from university staff in student support roles, and academic counsellors. These services can play a vital role in enabling you to meet your potential. However, many students find that by putting the right study strategies in place and ensuring good levels of self-care, they can build resilience and more effective ways of coping with problems as they come along.</p>

									<p>At some universities, peer support is available from other students through supported programmes. This can be organised within schools, faculties or residential accommodation. These are excellent opportunities to get advice from other students who have already been through the process and can provide hints and tips about how to get things done and study techniques, or just be someone to talk to. Check if your university offers peer support opportunities, and sign up if it does!</p>
