							<p>There are numerous organic compounds that cannot be produced by our bodies that are absolutely crucial for brain function. How do we get these? Through food, of course! It's not surprising that research shows that positive dietary behaviour, such as having regular nutritious meals throughout the day, has a beneficial impact on a student's academic achievements.</p>

									<flashcard-back variant="text">It is well established that foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, like fish and nuts, are essential for healthy brain function. Antioxidants are also important for cognition and aiding learning, and can be found in plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds.</flashcard-back>

									<flashcard-back variant="text">Some people use energy drinks to remain alert or energetic. These drinks are very high in sugar and caffeine, which impacts appetite and sleep cycles. Drinking energy drinks may give you an initial 'boost', but overconsuming them could lead to irritability, increased anxiety, gastrointestinal issues and other health problems. </flashcard-back>

									<flashcard-back variant="text">Studies show that even a few days of eating freshly prepared meals based on vegetables, grains, and fruits, and avoiding highly processed foods, is beneficial to our ability to concentrate, pay attention or memorise information. </flashcard-back>

									<pod-quote><p>For me, preparation is important. I try to plan my meals in advance during exam times, so I don't have to worry about it when it gets too hectic. The best tip I've found is cooking an extra portion and freezing it for later. I don't always remember to do this, but I try my best!</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I used to rely on energy drinks to keep me going through long study sessions, but have you ever read what is actually in them? I don't think it was doing me any good, so I stopped. I do like to snack whilst studying and use fun-size chocolates, nuts and popcorn as a tasty 'brain treat'.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>Preparation is the key. Because regular balanced meals are important to ensure a steady supply of nutrients to the brain, it's a good idea to be well organised when it comes to food. However, during hectic times in the semester, eating well may be the last thing you have on your mind.</p>

									<h4>Feedback:</h4>
									<p>Creating your strategies means that you are able to produce a plan that will be uniquely yours. This will help you to improve your eating habits. You should include simple steps that are sustainable and easy to follow. It is also a good idea to make your strategies specific and measurable. For example, if you would like to add more vegetables into your diet, initially plan to increase your weekly intake by three to four vegetable-based dishes. This achievable approach should help you to stay motivated and feel great about the changes you are making!</p>

							<p>The best way to ensure you are getting all of the required nutrients is by implementing small, sustainable changes in your diet and continuing to eat a wide range of foods. However, if you have special requirements or just feel that something is not quite right with your diet, seek advice from a professional.</p>
