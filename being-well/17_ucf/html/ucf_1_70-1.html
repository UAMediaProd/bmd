							<p>Whether you are a domestic, international, undergraduate or postgraduate student, it is always worth taking the time to see if there is any extra funding to which you may be entitled. Taking control of your finances can sometimes feel like a challenge, and money worries can be a great source of stress for students. Taking positive steps to solve them can have a huge impact on your overall wellbeing.</p>
