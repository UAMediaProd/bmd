							<p>A safety plan can be invaluable not only at times of crisis (when it is often harder to bring positive things to mind), but also as a day-to-day strategy for self-support. Like most things in life, prevention is better than cure and if you are able to develop positive mental health routines, you are less likely to encounter major problems. Or, if you do (as any of us can), you will have the resources and perhaps the resilience to find a less painful way through.</p>
							
							<instructional-text><p>Make a list of the internal and external support strategies you might include in your plan. A good hint is to be as specific as possible. For example, rather than "Ring a helpline", you could write "Ring Lifeline on 13 11 14". This means at times of difficulty you already have all the information you need. If you need to search for it, you are less likely to do it.</p></instructional-text>

Try to be as specific as possible, so instead of writing "Listen to music", write the names of specific artists or tracks that make you feel good. Remember, the more specific you can be, the better. You can make yourself a 'feel-good playlist' that you can use on a daily basis.
