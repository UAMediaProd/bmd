							<p>A budget helps to track your income against expenditure with the aim of avoiding getting into financial difficulty. Having a budget (set up as weekly or monthly) can help you to feel more in control of your spending, particularly if you have many different payments to keep track of.</p>
							<p>Do you have a budget and a way of tracking your spending?</p>

									<h4>Work out your income</h4>
									<p>Look at each of the different types of income you may have, such as your Centrelink payment or other fee support, rent assistance, part-time work, or support from family. This is your average annual income.</p>
								</process-page>

									<h4>Case study</h4>
									<p>Joe is a mature student and lives in a rented house. He receives ABSTUDY Centrelink payments of &dollar;565.70 per fortnight (19/20 financial year), rent assistance of &dollar;93.07 per fortnight and has a part-time job, from which he earns &dollar;10,000 a year (&dollar;384.62 a fortnight).</p>
									<p><strong>Joe's average annual income = &dollar;27,128.14 </strong></p>
									<p><strong>Joe's average fortnightly income = &dollar;1,043.39 </strong></p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Identify your essential expenditure</h4>
									<p>Consider your essential expenditure (things you need to pay for), such as:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Rent/residential college fees</li>
										<li>Food </li>
										<li>Utility bills </li>
										<li>Course-related costs, such as books and equipment</li>
										<li>Travel </li>
										<li>Contents insurance</li>
										<li>Medical costs (e.g. GP visits or prescriptions)</li>
										<li>Subscription costs (e.g. gym membership or TV subscriptions)</li>
										<li>Debt repayment (e.g. credit cards)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Don't forget to include something for social activities, and also savings to build up an 'emergency fund'. If you are not sure how much you spend on a particular item, check with your university's student services to see if they can offer some information on typical costs. For books and equipment, check the costs with your academic department.</p>

									<h4>Case study</h4>
									<p>Joe pays rent of &dollar;150 a week (he shares with one other full-time mature student) and pays towards gas, electricity (his share is &dollar;40 a week), insurance (&dollar;10 a month for his laptop and smartphone), travel (&dollar;50 a month for his student travel card), food (&dollar;70 per week on groceries for healthy, low-cost meals), books/printing/course-related costs (approx. &dollar;25 per fortnight), fitness (Joe spends &dollar;40 per fortnight on a gym membership, as exercise helps him manage his stress while studying), social/leisure costs (&dollar;50 per week going out with friends). He puts &dollar;30 a week into his savings account.</p>
									<p><strong>Joe's average fortnightly expenditure = &dollar;773. This means that his average annual expenditure is &dollar;20,098 (&dollar;773 &times; 26).</strong></p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>The moment of truth...</h4>
									<p>Now think about how long you want the budget for in the number of weeks or months. Depending on your situation, you can use either a 52-week (26 fortnights) or 42-week (21 fortnights) format for the budget. 52 weeks will cover the whole year, including the time you are at university and during the long summer break. If you want to create a budget for your time at university only, set it up to cover 42 weeks (this will cover the semester time, plus mid-semester, mid-year, revision periods and supplementary exam periods). Now deduct your total expenditure from your total income to work out what is left over each fortnight or year. This is the money that you have left over for any other costs that may arise during your time at university.</p>

									<h4>Case study</h4>
									<p>As we have seen, Joe's annual income is &dollar;27,128. His average annual expenditure is &dollar;20,098. He deducts the &dollar;20,098 expenditure from the &dollar;27,128 income to find an annual surplus of &dollar;7,030.</p>
									<p>Joe needs a 52-week budget to cover him for the entire year. He divides the &dollar;7,030 annual surplus by 26 to find a fortnightly surplus (disposable income) of &dollar;270. This is how much money Joe has to spend for the fortnight when he has paid all his essential expenditure.</p>
									<p>Joe is living well within his means. It is great that he is putting money into his savings each fortnight but he could look at increasing the amount he is saving each fortnight to cover unexpected expenses, such as his housemate moving out, or a reduction in his working hours. He is also insuring his valuable items, which will pay off in the long-term if he needs to make a claim.</p>

							<p>Using Joe's experience as a guide, it's now your turn to create a budget!</p>
							
							<instructional-text><p>Work though the different screens to create a budget.  Start with the income section. For each item, record the annual income you receive. Then move to the expenditure section. For each item, record the average annual expenditure using your recent transactions as a guide. Then record your total average income and total average expenditure. You will be supplied with the surplus (disposable income) or deficit (how much you are under) according to these figures. The final calculation will show you how much you have to spend each fortnight after the essential expenditure, or how much money you need to break even. </p></instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible><p>For this activity you will need a calculator. Create a budget using the sample tables provided. Start with the income section.

							<p>If you have a surplus amount of money, however small this may be, consider putting this into a separate savings account each fortnight so that funds are available in case a financial emergency should arise. This could be set up to run alongside your main bank account.</p>
