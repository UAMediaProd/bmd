							<p>University will give you opportunities to meet a wide range of people, from diverse
								backgrounds and with different perspectives, and to be part of a range of groups and
								communities.</p>
							<p>Good communication skills like empathy, listening and assertiveness will help you to make the
								most of these opportunities, to form networks of community and support, and to build your
								own belonging. You can also extend these skills to help you deal with conflicts that might
								sometimes arise. </p>

									<h4>A restorative approach to conflict</h4>

									<p>Jordan is in a panic. His group research assignment is due in a week, but the conflict in his group has escalated so much that he can't see how they will ever manage to submit and pass the assignment. The grade for the assignment contributes significantly to his final grade.</p>
									<p>Jordan decides to ask the members of the group <strong>restorative questions</strong> to see if there is a way to get back on track.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Restorative question 1: What happened?</h4>
									<p>First, each person needs an opportunity to explain what happened, from their own point of view.</p>
									<div class="charcter-container">
										<img src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/423/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/ysj_1_60_img2_aus.png" class="img-responsive">
										<h4>Angelo says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>At the last group meeting Rosie just blew up, shouted at all of us and stormed out. She really upset Niall.</text-quote></p>

										<img src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/423/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/ysj_1_60_img3_aus.png" class="img-responsive">
										<h4>Rosie says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>Angelo and Niall obviously don't want me in the group. They accused me of being deliberately obstructive, but they are the ones who haven't been listening.</text-quote></p>
									</div>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Restorative question 2: What were you thinking and feeling at the time?</h4>
									<p>Each person should have an opportunity to consider and express their thoughts and their feelings about what has happened.</p>
									<div class="charcter-container">
										<img src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/423/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/ysj_1_60_img2_aus.png" class="img-responsive">
										<h4>Angelo says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>Rosie has been obstructive from the start and kept missing the planning meetings. I was fed up with her going on about stuff we covered when she wasn't there. I told her it wasn't fair that she wasn't pulling her weight and she just lost it.</text-quote></p>
									</div>
									<div class="charcter-container">
										<img src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/423/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/ysj_1_60_img3_aus.png" class="img-responsive">
										<h4>Rosie says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>I was really upset when I got accused and put down in front of the group. They are the ones who kept setting group meetings in the pub, which is so noisy and distracting and obviously a ridiculous place to try and get any work done.</text-quote></p>
									</div>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Restorative question 3: What have you thought about it since then?</h4>
									<p>This gives an opportunity for each person to reflect on the situation and possibly acknowledge any contribution they may have made to the conflict.</p>
									<div class="charcter-container">
										<img src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/423/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/ysj_1_60_img2_aus.png" class="img-responsive">

										<p><text-quote>I probably didn't raise the issue very tactfully. But Rosie's response was unacceptable. It isn't fair that this is going to affect everyone's final grade.</text-quote></p>

										<h4>Rosie says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>I am sick of being ignored and pushed around. I was bullied a lot at school because of my autism, so I've kept quiet about it at university, but now it feels like it's happening all over again.</text-quote></p>

								<process-page>
									<h4>Restorative question 4: Who has been affected and what has the impact been?</h4>
									<p>This question gives each person an opportunity to recognise the impact of their own actions on others, as well as how they have been affected.</p>

										<img src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/423/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/ysj_1_60_img2_aus.png" class="img-responsive">
										<h4>Angelo says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>The whole group has been affected by Rosie's behaviour. Niall is a bit scared of her &ndash; she is so unpredictable. We are all worried about the assignment. We want to do it without her, but we'll get marked down if we leave her out. She is probably quite worried about it too.</text-quote></p>

										<h4>Rosie says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>I feel embarrassed about my meltdown and I am worried about the assignment. I have been feeling really low, and even wondered about quitting university. The group will probably be pleased if I leave.</text-quote></p>
									</div>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Restorative question 5: What needs to happen to make it right?</h4>
									<p>This question asks each person to think about realistic suggestions to put the conflict behind them and move forward constructively.</p>
									<div class="charcter-container">
										<img src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/423/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/ysj_1_60_img2_aus.png" class="img-responsive">

										<h4>Rosie says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>Angelo and Niall need to listen and take me into account &ndash; I can't think straight in the noisy environment in the pub. Perhaps I should explain a bit more about how my autism affects me. The group should give me a chance, because I think I have some good ideas for the project that no one has thought of.</text-quote></p>
									</div>
								</process-page>

									<h4>Restorative outcomes</h4>

										<p><text-quote>I didn't realise how difficult it was for Rosie to meet at the pub. She showed us a quieter place at the library where she likes to work and our last group meeting went really well. Rosie actually had a brilliant idea for the project and it's all coming together &ndash; just in time!</p></text-quote>

										<h4>Rosie says</h4>
										<p><text-quote>I am sorry my meltdown upset everyone so much &ndash; sometimes when there is too much to process at once I just can't handle it. I am glad I told the others about my autism, because now they have agreed to meet in the library and they also listened to my ideas. We still have to work hard to get the assignment in, but I think we will do well.</text-quote></p>

									<h4>Restorative conflict resolution</h4>
									<p>The restorative questions helped Jordan and his group mates sort out the group conflict that might have affected each of their grades. For future group projects, Jordan decides that he will suggest making a 'group agreement' at the start, having a discussion about everyone's preferences and agreeing basic rules for how the group will operate, which take everyone's needs into account.</p>
									<p>Restorative conflict resolution is about finding ways to repair harm and restore constructive interaction and behaviour. Consent is an important part of respectful, restorative interactions. No one should be pushed into sharing information about themselves they are not comfortable sharing, and someone with a disability does not have to disclose this to others.</p>
									<p>It is important to make sure that everyone has a fair opportunity to be heard and that interactions are respectful and consensual. It can be helpful to have someone neutral to facilitate, preferably a trained mediator if there is significant conflict or harm to be repaired.</p>
									<p>See the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod on the screen titled: <em>Adapting to changes</em> for an example of how one university offers support for conflict resolution.</p>

									<p>You would probably be careful to include someone whose disability was obvious, but some disabilities are known as 'hidden disabilities', which may not be seen by others. You may lack understanding of the impact on the person, too. Before jumping to blame or judge someone for behaviour you don't understand, consider whether there may be issues affecting them that you aren't aware of.</p>
									<p>If a fellow student mentions a disability like autism or a mental health problem, don't be afraid to ask them how it affects them, whether there is anything you can do to ensure that their needs are accommodated, and if there is anything you need to know to ensure you aren't inadvertently making it harder for them.</p>

							<p>Restorative skills help to create an inclusive environment which focuses on finding common
								ground while accommodating diverse perspectives and needs. Differences of opinion and
								conflicts are an inevitable part of human interaction, but with the right attitude they can
								serve as opportunities to develop your communication skills and build even stronger
								understanding and connections with others. </p>
							<p>There are so many different opportunities to be part of supportive groups and communities at
								university. You can continue to extend your experiences and networks throughout your student
								journey by remaining open to the wide variety of options available (see the module titled:
								<em>Study-life balance</em> for more ideas). By building and exercising your communication skills you can contribute to the strong, inclusive communities that promote belonging and success for all.</p>

I had carried on partying hard but most of the others were getting more serious about their work, so they were getting upset with me coming in late drunk, making a noise and leaving a mess. I got really defensive when they first brought it up with me, but then my mate took me aside and told me it was upsetting him as well. I realised I needed to apologise and sort myself out.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>We had a few problems in our sports club, with some of the guys posting inappropriate comments on the WhatsApp group about some of the girls. It got really out of hand, so the students' association advised us to get mediation. The mediation process was really helpful, as everyone felt like they had their side of the story heard, and we worked out a constructive way forward. I think that worked much better than the guys just getting some kind of punishment, which wouldn't have changed their behaviour.</p></pod-quote>
