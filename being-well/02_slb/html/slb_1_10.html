									<pod-quote>I keep to a 9-5 routine most weekdays: I aim to be in the library (or at lectures) by 9am, take a good break for lunch and then back at it for the afternoon. Being in the library also stops me procrastinating &ndash; I can't go and run errands or do things around the flat instead of working, which I know I would do if I was at home. That leaves my whole evening free to socialise, keep fit, cook &ndash; whatever I want.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Jon, 20</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>I just know I work better in the evenings. When others are going home for tea, I eat early and then head to the library for 6pm and get a really good four hours' work in. It's tempting to stay longer, and sometimes I do &ndash; but then I lose the whole morning by sleeping in, so mostly I have a bit of a wind down and am in bed by midnight.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Farhan, 22</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>One of the best (and most difficult to do) tips I got was to switch my notifications off when I was working. But I have to say it helped &ndash; there were fewer distractions, and I saved them up for when I took breaks. And I set my alarm for the end of the break, so I didn't get hooked into reading the next post!</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Nancy, 19</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>I like to get in an early gym session to free up more time later in the day. At the start of semester, I was lucky to get classes that end before 3pm, as I have to pick up my younger brother and sister from school. There's a lot to do as it's just me and Dad looking after the family but planning my time has helped me to not become too overwhelmed.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Brandon, 24</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>I wasn't always the best at organising things, but after watching other students' study routines online, I have developed a system that works for me. I use a 7 day planner that is colour coded to my subjects and allocates space for work, exercise and down time. It helps me feel in control, as all my assessments, family birthdays and festival dates are booked in. This way I don't miss out on anything or feel guilty for studying too much or too little.</pod-quote>

							<p>Establishing a good study-life balance is part of appreciating yourself not just as a 'student', but as a whole person. This module focuses particularly on managing time, getting enough sleep and investing in relationships. These are all part of looking after your mind and your body; keeping these in good shape is core to doing well at your studies. See this as your long-term strategy to support your success as a student.</p>
							<p>Managing your time at university can feel different to anything you have done before, with most of it down to you to juggle and plan. It can be easy to imagine you can get everything done without ever mapping out your expectations of yourself, so a good starting point is to consider how you already spend your time at university or, if you have not started yet, how you imagine spending it.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>For each type of activity, record the amount of time you spend on it in each of the columns. If there is a big variation in the days, try to work out an average figure. At the bottom of the table, the total number of hours per week that you spend on all your activities, and the number of hours you have left to schedule, will be automatically calculated. Then click for feedback.</p></instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible>
								<p>You will need a calculator for this activity. Consider the activities provided in the sample table. For each type of activity, record the amount of time you spend on it <strong>per day</strong> and how many days <strong>per week</strong>. If there is a big variation in the days, try to work out an average figure. </p>
								<p>As you note how much time you dedicate to each activity per day, calculate the amount of time you spend on it per week by multiplying that number by seven. </p>
								<p>You have a total of <strong>168 hours</strong> (the number of hours in a week) available to schedule. You might find it helpful to track the running total of the time you are spending per week as you add a new activity to help you track where you are spending your time and to ensure you are not going over the maximum number of hours. </p>
								<p>When you have finished, continue on for feedback.</p>

								  <node-content>This means getting the most out of the time you have. Everyone does this differently, but there are some core things to think about. A good starting point is to begin an activity by asking, "Is this worth my time?" and to finish it with, "Am I glad I did that?"</node-content>
								</central-concept>
								<concept-nodes>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Know yourself</node-heading>
									<node-content>Are you a morning person or an evening person? Do you work best alone or in a group? Do you need to be alone or with others to relax and refuel? It's important to know what works for you, and to work with, not against, yourself. If you focus better in the evenings, then use that time for the difficult tasks and do more routine things in the morning &ndash; or vice versa, if you spring out of bed ready to do your best.</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Have a daily/weekly routine</node-heading>
									<node-content>Students often set their own schedules around the lectures, seminars and tutorials that are part of their course. Having a routine saves a lot of time otherwise spent thinking about what to do. The routine can take account of when you are most alert and focused &ndash; don't choose those times to do your laundry! End each day knowing what you plan to do tomorrow &ndash; write yourself a list before you stop for the day. This saves time having to remember where you were up to later.</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Prioritise</node-heading>
									<node-content>Priorities change over time, so take a look at your priorities every week to make sure they are up to date. Check whether they are important, urgent or both &ndash; the latter goes to the top of the list. Priorities need to take in commitments to family, friends, paid work and volunteering as well as study. As well as <em>what</em> needs doing, think about <em>how</em> you are going to do it &ndash; this will give you a better idea of the time required. Use lists &ndash; priorities need to be written down, not just be in your head. </node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Use a time planner </node-heading>
									<node-content>University deadlines often come in a bunch, and everyone else will be looking for the same library books or lab space at the same time as you. Planning ahead is the only way around this &ndash; check the time planner in the 'Download' pod to get started. Always allow time for things to go wrong &ndash; no schedule will work perfectly! If you fall behind your schedule, make the time up as soon as possible &ndash; it becomes harder the longer you leave it. And include time to relax!</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Time is finite</node-heading>
									<node-content>We can have this internal picture of a perfect time manager who can always do everything. This can relate to perfectionism, when nothing feels good enough to hand in. But good time management means knowing that time is finite, and making conscious choices about how you are going to use it; what you are and are <em>not</em> going to do. It does not mean being ruthless with yourself or making unreasonable demands on yourself or others. Time is like money in the bank, only without the overdraft facility &ndash; you can't borrow forward!</node-content>
								  </concept-node>
								  <concept-node>
									<node-heading>Personal fulfilment</node-heading>
									<node-content>Personal fulfilment is just as important as academic success. Being at university offers many activities and opportunities outside of your course that are just as much part of being a student, and all of it contributes to developing you as a whole person. Making time to keep yourself in good emotional and physical shape will mean that you work and study better too. </node-content>

							  <p>We can't make more time, but we can all make better use of the time that we have. Balance is important &ndash; time to work, time to rest and time to have fun are all part of being well, staying well and succeeding as a student.</p>

                                <p>You can support your friends by accepting their way of managing time and not calling them out as anti-social or 'killjoys' just because they don't want to do things when you want to do them. Keep them included in invitations; just because someone says no to a movie night once because of a deadline doesn't mean they wouldn't be pleased to be asked the next time.</p>
