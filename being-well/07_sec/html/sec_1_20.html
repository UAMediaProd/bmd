										<p><strong>Jack is at a party...</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Jack (thinking):</strong> No one is talking to me. Charlie said hello to me when I first arrived, but he hasn't come over since. There was that good-looking boy from my class who smiled at me when I got a drink, but he didn't speak to me. That must be because I'm not very interesting and no one likes me.</p>

										<note-question><p>How is Jack creating a barrier between himself and others at the party?</p></note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>Jack is putting all the responsibility for his enjoyment of the party onto others, but no one knows they have been given this responsibility. Besides, it is as difficult for others to instigate a conversation with Jack as it is for him to do so with them, especially as he is standing on his own by a wall, and looking uninterested in having a conversation. It is always a risk to speak to someone new, but Jack has done this many times before. The benefits of it possibly going well far outweigh the short-term negatives of it being a bit awkward at the start. Jack needs to be proactive so that he goes from being <em>at</em> the party, to being a <em>part of</em> the party. He could try using open questions to encourage conversation, such as "What do you think of the music?" to show he is engaged and interested in socialising.</note-feedback>

										<p><strong>Editor:</strong> I need someone to write a review of The Puppets when they play their gig in town, who's up for it?</p>
										<p><strong>Manoj (thinking):</strong> I love that band. It would be amazing to go and see them. But she won't pick me; she never does so I won't bother to put my hand up. Besides, there are much better writers than me around this table.</p>

										<note-question><p>What would be the benefits of Manoj putting himself forward to write the article?</p></note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>If Manoj puts his hand up and volunteers, he might be chosen to review the band. If he does not, he certainly will not be chosen. By choosing not to put his hand up and justifying why he didn't ("I'm not good enough") Manoj feels he is protecting himself from the likely pain of rejection. But by raising his hand, he will open the possibility of things going in his favour, and he will likely enjoy the experience. Manoj knows he needs to be more assertive and ignore his "I'm not good enough" voice, but it is hard as it is so ingrained. He could tell himself he is at least able to physically raise his hand, and concentrate on that as something he knows he can do, finding the strength to speak from there.</note-feedback>

										<p><strong>Grace has just seen a message in her friends' group chat...</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Grace (thinking):</strong> What does Rosie mean by that message? She thinks she's being funny but that's just cruel. It's true though, I should never have worn that dress. I knew it didn't suit me. Now everyone is laughing at me.</p>

										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>Like most people, Grace takes perceived criticism very personally, and is naturally upset. Grace can continue to catastrophise, or recognise that this is one specific criticism from one specific person and not an absolute truth. It would be helpful for Grace to talk to someone close to her who can reassure her and help her to ignore the comments. What would you say to a friend in this situation? Grace needs someone to help her provide a different perspective to the criticism.</note-feedback>

										<p><strong>Amelia is working on a group project...</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Amelia (thinking):</strong> Why can't they stop messing about? We have to get this group project sorted tonight. Why is it always me that ends up doing all of the work? I wish I could get them to help out and stop taking advantage of me.</p>

										<note-question><p>How could Amelia help to improve the group dynamic?</p></note-question>
										<note-input></note-input>
										<note-feedback>We are all more affected by group dynamics than we like to think. Speaking up against what seem to be shared group norms is hard because we tend to attribute beliefs as being shared by the whole group. This is often not the case and speaking up can help change group behaviour. In Amelia's scenario, the whole group has the same shared goal (with a shared deadline), so if she reminds them of the indisputable fact of the impending deadline, it will likely help to focus their attention.</note-feedback>

							<p>As with the examples, you will find yourself in situations where you may not feel confident or particularly comfortable speaking up and this can have an impact on your self-esteem. Yet in other situations, particularly where you are in a more familiar setting &ndash; for example, with friends and family &ndash; you might feel confident to act. This is normal. It is worth reflecting on what you do, think or say in familiar situations, as it is very likely that the same strategies will work just as well in a new situation.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Think back to an occasion in the past when you had self-doubt or lacked confidence but still managed to get through (e.g. starting at high school, sitting your hardest exam, participating in a group activity or having a difficult conversation with a friend). What did you do that helped? This may be an action, a thought process or perhaps there was a person who helped boost your confidence. Write the first point and then click on the 'Plus' symbol to reveal the next space. You can add up to six points. If you write fewer than six points you must click on the 'Plus' symbol to ensure that your text is captured in the summary. Then click for some feedback.</p></instructional-text>

									<h4>Feedback:</h4>
									<p>You've managed to get through all those experiences, and you'll have many more ahead of you. It can be hard to think of what has helped in the past, as people are good at being self-critical. Learning to see the positive possibilities is a key part of increasing resilience and building confidence and self-esteem. Come back to your list and add to it whenever you can think of skills you have used (or can use) in managing challenging situations.</p>

							<p>It is likely that you are the person most critical of you in the entire world. You almost certainly will be more compassionate to others than you are to yourself. This is why recognising the skills you already have to manage challenging situations is important. Practise thinking: "What would I say to a friend in my situation?" and apply that compassionate response to yourself when things get tough. </p>
