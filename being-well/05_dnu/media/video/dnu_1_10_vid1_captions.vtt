00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I would say my diet
is quite healthy.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.178 align:middle line:84%
Although, I do
allow myself to have

00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:13.370 align:middle line:84%
treats every now and then
or at special occasions.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:90%
I eat, pretty much, everything.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a fussy eater at all.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So I like to stick to lots
of protein and veggies,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.090 align:middle line:90%
but I also love chocolate.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So, pretty much,
every day, I might

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
have a bit of chocolate, which
might not be the best for me,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:90%
but it gets me through the day.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Apart from that,
I eat all dairy.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
allergies or anything.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm, very much, open
to trying new foods.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
But I have a few staples
that I know how to cook.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So pasta, chicken,
steak. that I like

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
to keep to, just because I
know how to cook them well,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:90%
and they're cheap and easy.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I am pescaterian, which
means I don't eat any meat,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.960 align:middle line:90%
except for fish and seafood.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And wherever possible, I try
and avoid eating fish, dairy,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:90%
and eggs, as well.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm mainly pescaterian
for environmental reasons

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:90%
and animal rights reasons.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
My diet when I'm home
mainly consists of foods

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:90%
that are not highly processed.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So I try and cook a
lot of vegetables,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also
terrible at cooking.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So I eat a lot of pasta, soups,
pretty basic curries, bean

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.430 align:middle line:90%
mixes.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
When I'm not at home, I tend to
eat a lot of takeaway and just,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:84%
food that's really
cheap to get on the go.
