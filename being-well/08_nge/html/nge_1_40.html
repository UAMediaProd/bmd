									<pod-quote><p>I have high expectations because I'm always trying to prove myself. I'm the first person to go to university in my family &ndash; so I don't think it is the same for me as it is for other students. For a long time, I worried that perhaps I didn't belong at university or would just fail. Realising that everyone has these types of fears was an important step for me.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I do feel a bit of pressure to perform to a higher level than my classmates &ndash; I feel that it's expected because of the age and experience gap. I try to remind myself that we're all learning new things together and that it's not a competition, but every now and then the thoughts creep in.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I find that perfectionism is a bit of an obsession. It's like I'm always trying to be better than myself. I try to be conscious of when I'm being perfectionistic and remind myself that I am good enough, because I know that constantly being perfectionistic leads to unrealistic expectations and burnout.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>As we have explored, perfectionism can have a negative impact on university life &ndash; your motivation may suffer, you may not perform as well as you hoped, and you may feel less positively about yourself or those around you. However, it is possible to anticipate when perfectionistic thoughts might cause an issue, and put plans in place to help deal with them.</p>

							<instructional-text>
								<p>In order to manage the impact of perfectionism on your student life, you will need to reflect on the ways in which you are perfectionistic. Consider each question, using the 'Hint' to help prompt your thoughts. Write your thoughts in the text box, then click for feedback.</p>

									<node-heading>Managing perfectionism</node-heading>
									<node-content>
										<p>People can learn to manage perfectionism and the negative behaviours associated with perfectionism. This involves making deliberate attempts to identify, reflect upon and change negative thoughts and behaviours. There are lots of techniques to help you do this &ndash; often they do not take a large amount of time but they do need some practice.</p>
									</node-content>
								</central-concept>
								<concept-nodes>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Notice the positives </node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Perfectionism can make you focus mainly (or only) on negative information you receive. This can mean focusing on the small things that are not quite right, rather than on the big things that are going well. This includes praise and criticism you receive from others. To help prevent this, when you find yourself thinking about the negatives, pause, and purposefully think about the things that are going well and focus on things other than yourself. </p>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Changing thinking patterns</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Perfectionism involves a negative thinking style that includes having double standards (being harsh on yourself and not others for the same behaviour), strict self-demands ("I should...") and overgeneralising ("Because I failed that test, I am a failure"). To help change the way you think, you could write your negative thoughts down, rate them in terms of how strongly you believe each statement (0&ndash;100%), and then challenge the thoughts by asking yourself: "Is this thought helping me? Could I view things differently? What positives am I missing about the situation?" This is called a thought diary. It can also be used to reflect on your demands of other people. For more information on changing your thinking patterns, see the module titled: <em>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience.</em></p>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Get things started</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Procrastination is a problem that is associated with perfectionism. It can be difficult to start and complete tasks when you are worried about them not being perfect or 'good enough'. Assessing your task using positive statements, such as "I have written lots of assignments before", "I will feel better when I start" or "People will like me no matter what I do", can be helpful in overcoming perfectionism. These can be put on flashcards, used as a screensaver or even sent to yourself in an email.</p>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Making time for fun</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Focusing on perfection can be exhausting. It can also leave very little time to relax, spend time with friends, and do things just for fun (rather than to achieve something). You will therefore need to be more deliberate in scheduling in these types of activities. Taking time to do other things and relaxing will mean you will have more energy when it comes to completing your studies or placement work. Remember, fun means fun for everyone so this time needs to be free from any demands you place on others too. </p>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Test your beliefs </node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Being perfectionistic means you can have several incorrect beliefs about others. For example, "If my room is untidy, my friends will think I'm lazy and dirty". You can test and challenge these beliefs by speaking with other people, in this case friends, to see if these beliefs are true or not. You can also test the beliefs more literally (e.g. invite your friends round and see if they comment on how untidy the room is). Note, very few people have a perfectly tidy home!</p>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Seeking support</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Self-help strategies can be useful to help manage perfectionism. However, if it is affecting your life in more serious ways (such as experiencing mental health difficulties), you should consider seeking advice from trained professionals. Write down the details of people you can contact if you need professional support, such as counselling services at your university. You might not ever need to contact them, but put their details in your phone just in case. </p>

							<p>Managing and overcoming perfectionism is not easy. It takes time and practice. Students often
								find themselves thinking and behaving in the same perfectionistic ways even after using
								these strategies, and when they thought that they had their perfectionism in check. This is
								common and all part of managing perfectionism. The most important thing is that you can
								learn to be less perfectionistic and have a happier and healthier time at university. </p>
