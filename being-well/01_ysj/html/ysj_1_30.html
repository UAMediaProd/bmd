							<p>While studying, you may be commuting daily from an established home, establishing a new permanent home, or moving into a new temporary home at the start of each academic year. Either way, it is worthwhile thinking about how to establish the best possible 'home base' for whatever stage you are at on your journey, in your personal space and on campus.</p>
							<p>A good home base starts with your own personal space &ndash; making sure it's a welcoming place where you can feel safe, be yourself, rest and recharge. If you are comfortable studying at your university, try to find multiple spaces on campus where you can work between or after your scheduled classes, as well as those for relaxation and breaks from study.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I promised my mum I would have a proper phone call or Skype with her every Sunday, so she wouldn't worry about me. I thought that was mainly for her sake, but looking back I realise it really helped me too, just to touch base with home on a regular basis.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Dan, 18</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>When I was having problems with anxiety I learnt some really useful relaxation and mindfulness skills at the counselling and wellbeing services on campus. I've been making sure I practise these every day to help with the stress of getting my final assessments done and revising to get the grades I need for future jobs. I know the regular mindfulness routine will really help me continue to perform well in my work, making sure I catch myself when I'm getting too perfectionist and self-critical.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Samira, 25</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I've got my old surfing posters up in my room, and a mascot from my old football team that I keep on my bed. They make me smile because they remind me of happy times with my mates back home. They helped me deal with the initial homesickness, and I'll definitely hang onto them when I move out of student accommodation because it feels like they remind me about what's important to me.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Jake, 19</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I used to waste valuable study time socialising between lectures and having to catch up later at night. Now, I go to the library whenever I have a break between lectures of more than 30 minutes. There's a really good quiet study area with a view of the park, where I like to go. Some of us on my course also agreed that we'd have a group study session after our Thursday morning lecture, because that module is particularly difficult so it helps to talk it through afterwards or discuss the latest assignment. I still hang out and socialise in the shorter breaks between classes, so it feels like it's a win-win.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Asaf, 31</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>It's been a bit of an adjustment with me starting my degree, and my husband and I were getting into quite a few arguments at first. We realised we needed to sit down and work out a clear agreement about how to share out the domestic chores differently. We laughed about it in the end, because my husband remembered how he used to fall out with his friends over cleaning chores when he did his degree all those years ago! It all just works better when you've talked things out and everyone knows where they stand, doesn't it?</p></pod-quote>

							<p>As you can see from some of the suggestions on this screen, a 'home base' is not just about familiar places, but also about the emotional security that comes from familiar routines and supportive relationships. It's important to create and maintain a good home base by keeping in touch with our existing sources of security and maintaining helpful routines while we start to build new sources of familiarity, support and connection. </p>
							<p>What are your next steps for improving your university home base?</p>
							<p>Setting up a good home base is like laying a solid foundation for a building. When you meet challenges and things feel a bit shaky, check your foundations and think about what you can do to strengthen them. These ideas will apply as you move on from university and establish a home base for your working life.</p>
