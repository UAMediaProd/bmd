							<p>When we talk about perfectionism, we are really talking about specific behaviours and ways of thinking that are unique to each person. It is important to be able to recognise these things in ourselves and other people, and understand how they can influence our behaviour, often unconsciously.</p>

								<p>Click on each flashcard for information on different aspects of perfectionism. Think about if they relate to you, or someone you know.</p>

							<accessible-text><p>We all have our own unique ways of being perfectionistic. Continue on for some different aspect of perfectionism. For each one, think if this describes you or people you know.</p></accessible-text>
