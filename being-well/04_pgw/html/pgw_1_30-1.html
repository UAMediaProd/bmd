							<p>There are lots of reasons why postgraduate research students may feel a sense of isolation. Research is often carried out independently, and even if you are in a lab with other researchers working in similar areas, it is normal to feel that you are the only one who might be struggling, even though this isn't true!</p>

							<p>Sometimes isolation is a self-fulfilling cycle &ndash; the more isolated you feel, the less likely you are to reach out to other people, ending up feeling even more isolated, and so on. It might not be easy to make that first move, but actually that's the most important step in breaking the cycle of isolation. For more information on building a support network and finding a sense of belonging at university, see the module titled: <em>Your student journey.</em> It is also worth considering taking up activities that you enjoy and find relaxing or that help you to 'switch off' from your studies.  For example, running, knitting, reading, playing computer games, etc.  Whilst these are all activities you can undertake on your own, you could also join clubs or attend meetups of like-minded people.</p>

									<p>Your university will have a lot of different groups and societies for students to explore. These may be networks formed around areas of study or common interests, such as creative writing or badminton. Contact your students' association to see if there is anything that sparks your interest.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I'm a historian and my PhD involved me spending long hours by myself in an obscure archive. Other than the person who managed the archive, I literally could go for days without talking with anyone. By nature, I'm quite a loner so at first it didn't bother me, but after time I noticed that I was becoming quite withdrawn. I started to make the effort to go onto campus each week to join in the weekly coffee morning of humanities research students and over time I found that I was feeling a lot more motivated about my research. We just had coffee and cake (of course!) and shared our experiences &ndash; it was nothing formal or complicated and I felt really comfortable there. It made a big difference to my enjoyment of my PhD.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>Working on your own and being self-motivated are important skills when doing a research project, but there is a fine line between working well alone and becoming unhealthily isolated. It's important to recognise when you might be shunning the company of others and feeling unhappy and lonely. At this point, try to reach out to others who can help you or take that first step in taking up activities outside of your studies that can help break this negative cycle. You'll also find that you can help other people in the same situation by doing things such as inviting them for coffee or attending a research seminar together.</p>
							<p>Please remember that in difficult situations, organisations like Lifeline are always online and at the end of the phone for you to talk to. (See the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for the contact details of Lifeline.)</p>
