							<p>How well do you think you are managing your sexual health and wellbeing so far? Is there anything you would like to work on?</p>

							<accessible-text><p>Using the learning from this module, think about the things you would like to improve about your sexual health and make a list. For example, you could make an appointment for an STI test if you have had unprotected sex and discuss contraception options with a health care professional if you are sexually active.</p></accessible-text>
							<instructional-text><p>Using the learning from this module, think about the things you would like to improve about your sexual health. We have made some suggestions to get you started, and you can add them to the list if they are applicable. Enter your first point, then click on the 'Plus' symbol to reveal the next line. You can add up to six points. If you add fewer than six points, you need to click on the 'Plus' symbol to ensure your text is captured in the summary.</p></instructional-text>
