							<p>This screen offers the opportunity to create an action plan to help deal with any issues caused by your experience of perfectionism.</p>

							<instructional-text>
								<p>Make a list of strategies that you can use to avoid being too perfectionistic, and think about sources of support. We've added the first two for you. Write your first point and then click on the 'Plus' symbol to reveal the next space. You can add up to six additional points. If you write fewer than six points you must click on the 'Plus' symbol to ensure that your text is captured in the summary. Then click for some feedback.</p>

							<instructional-text-accessible><p>Make a list of strategies that you can use to avoid being too perfectionistic, and think about sources of support. For example, you might want to put the telephone number of student services at your university in your phonebook, or make time in the week to do something relaxing or fun that is not related to university work and is not about competition. Then continue for feedback.</p></instructional-text-accessible>

									<h4>Feedback:</h4>
									<p>Learning to be less perfectionistic is possible, but it takes time and effort. Think about the strategies we have covered in this module. Which ones do you think will work for you? Are there any others you can think of? There are no right or wrong ways to manage perfectionism, and you will find what works best for you!</p>
