							<p>It is normal to feel overloaded with responsibility during your studies. As well as being a postgraduate researcher, you will also have other important roles in life such as parent, carer, partner or full- or part-time employee. What are some of the additional roles and identities that you are juggling? Some of these might be beneficial for you and lead to positive career opportunities, but some of them may also make you feel conflicted and exhausted. Let's have a look at how these may cause additional pressure during your studies, possibly contributing to feeling overwhelmed.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I was one of several PhD students in my department who were encouraged to do tutoring and lecturing to earn extra money. It was a really good introduction to teaching and, in spite of the added time pressures, I did feel that it was a really beneficial thing to do. I also had the opportunity to do a one-day 'Introduction to Teaching' course at my uni and I think that was something really positive to put on my CV at the end of my degree. It also helped me network with other students who were doing the same thing and we supported each other when we felt it all got a bit overwhelming.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I found that my period of doctoral studies was full of complex contradictions that I had to navigate carefully. My relationship with my supervisor was a bit difficult and I found that he would ask me to do lots of extra work for his benefit, rather than mine, and I had to learn how to say "no" really quite strongly! It took me some time to develop that skill so my PhD did take longer than it should have done. It is also difficult living with constrained finances and I did take on some additional laboratory teaching work to help a bit &ndash; but again, that also had an impact on how long my studies took! It was definitely worth it in the end though.</p></pod-quote>

										<mcq-question>Jin is in his final year of a PhD in Biosciences. He has had feedback that his thesis is nearly ready to submit and that he has done enough experiments &ndash; he just needs to write up. His supervisor, however, keeps setting him extra experiments to do which are taking up a lot of time, distracting him from writing up. Jin thinks that his supervisor is trying to boost his own publications by using Jin's work. How should he deal with this?</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Jin should clarify why he is being asked to do the extra experiments with his supervisor</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback><p>Jin needs to agree on a submission deadline with his supervisor and clarify why he is being asked to do the extra experiments. If the experiments contribute to a wider project that the supervisor is working on, Jin should consider negotiating to prioritise the write-up and submission first, and then do the experiments in the period between thesis submission and examination. Jin may find it difficult to talk to his supervisor in this way as the supervisory relationship does involve a power dynamic, but having a conversation around this issue is the most important first step. There is further information on working with supervisors on the screen titled: <em>Managing the supervisor relationship</em>.</p></mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>Maeva is a self-funded international student. She faces financial difficulties and needs to work extra hours at the local supermarket. She's in danger of contravening the strict university regulation about the maximum number of hours she can work each week, and is endangering her visa status. What should she do?</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Maeva should work as many hours as she can &ndash; she needs the money and can explain the situation if she gets caught</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback><p>Maeva could discuss the situation with her supervisor and ask whether there are additional loans or financial hardship payments that she could apply for at the university. Failing this, she may wish to discuss the option of changing her mode of study to part-time, which would enable her to do more paid hours of work. It is important that she does not endanger her visa status, as she may have to leave her study programme as a result.</p></mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>Charlotte is undertaking part-time study doing a professional doctorate with a view to advancing her current career. She is being sponsored by her employer but faces considerable conflict between her identity as a full-time manager, important work deadlines and the studying required on her course. She is in her first year, has been consistently late in submitting assignments and has asked for extensions on two occasions due to work pressure. What should she do?</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Charlotte just needs to knuckle down and get her assignments done on time &ndash; even if that means ignoring her work commitments</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback><p>Charlotte needs to sit down with her supervisor and discuss the issues with them. They will probably reinforce the point that the deadlines cannot be frequently extended due to work issues, but they may be able to make allowances in the meantime. She could also ask their advice on better planning and time management or where she could get additional support at the university. Her conflict is due in part to wanting to be seen to be a good employee by the company that is paying for her to do the degree, but she is putting pressure on herself to perform highly in both her studies and at work. She should arrange to talk to her manager at work and agree some relaxation of responsibilities and duties as part of a package from her employer to support her in her studies. If she does this, she could also communicate back to her supervisor that she has had discussions with her employer to let them know that she is trying to manage it at both ends.</p></mcq-feedback>

							<p>With growing numbers of international students, and those taking non-traditional pathways into higher education, it is becoming increasingly common for postgraduate research students to be working or caring for family members whilst undertaking their studies. Not only does this make it harder to achieve a good work-life balance but there is also role identity conflict and a feeling of 'not belonging' to the traditional concept of what a postgraduate researcher looks like. </p>
