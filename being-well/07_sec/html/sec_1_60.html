							<p>Maintaining strategies to manage your NATs and feelings is difficult because the complexity of human interactions means there is nothing that works perfectly all the time. Confidence, self-esteem and resilience are not just in the moment but are affected by how we process things. All of us will, at times, find ourselves in challenging situations, but knowing you have prospered in challenging situations before will give you confidence.</p>

							<P>Developing the skills and strategies to raise confidence, self-esteem and resilience is a lifelong learning. As we have seen, these attributes depend upon a complex matrix of people, places, moods and situations. Acknowledging this is important, so that you do not fall into a fixed mindset of "I am" or "I am not".</P>

									<pod-quote><p>It is so easy to minimise, or even forget altogether, when I do things well. Regularly sitting down and reflecting on how I've overcome issues has been invaluable to me. It helps to keep my self-talk positive, and I feel more secure about any upcoming challenges when I look back on what I did well. </p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Tukta, 21</em></p>
									<pod-quote><p>Remembering to be kind to myself has helped me build my confidence and self-esteem as I adjust to life in Australia. I give myself time to process things gradually, rather than forcing myself to always 'do better'. I focus on what I can do and achieve, instead of feeling bad for things I cannot do. Doing positive self-talk is helpful. I talk to myself when I feel anxious, saying things like "It's normal to feel confused", "It's OK if I don't know something", "Be patient, you just need more time" and "It's OK to make mistakes because nobody is perfect".</p></pod-quote>
