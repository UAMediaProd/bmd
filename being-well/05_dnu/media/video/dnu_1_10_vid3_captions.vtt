00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Pasta with a sauce that is made
from tomatoes, garlic, onion,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.220 align:middle line:84%
olives, maybe some
eggplant or zucchini.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's, pretty much, it.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Probably a poke bowl.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I find it's a really
quick, easy way

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:84%
to just get a lot
of different veggies

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and sources of nutritional
food in one place, one hit.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the key
for me, especially

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
throughout
university, has really

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:90%
been about keeping it simple.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'll make sure I
have good basics on hand

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:84%
like a hummus or an
eggplant dip, both of which

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
are readily available
at supermarkets.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But are also really cheap
and simple to make at home.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And I can toss
them in some wraps

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
or into a salad with some
roasted vegetables on the side.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's really easy.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is if I've
got some time on a Sunday

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
or during the week,
I'll batch cook.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'll make a big
vegetarian chili,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
which I can have for
dinners throughout the week.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:84%
My personal go-to meal I can
prepare in a very short time

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:84%
is a can of tuna
and boil vegetable.
