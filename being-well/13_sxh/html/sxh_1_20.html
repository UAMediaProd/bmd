							<p>There are a lot of different contraception options out there. Some use hormones, some are short-term solutions while others are long-lasting, some are free and others you may have to pay for. Thinking about your own situation and preferences will help you decide which is best for you.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>My doctor told me I could try a contraceptive injection that I could administer myself at home. I think it would suit me as I'm looking for something longer-lasting and you only need to do the injection every three months.</p></pod-quote>

									<tab-heading>Contraceptive ring</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>A plastic ring that is inserted into the vagina. Sits up around the cervix for three weeks at a time and releases hormones to prevent pregnancy.</p>
										<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Put in or remove when you want to.</p>
										<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can take some practice to insert correctly, and does not protect from STIs.</p>
									</tab-content>

								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Contraceptive injection</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>Injections you get once every three months to prevent pregnancy.</p>
										<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Long-lasting, and you don't have to take a pill every day.</p>
										<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Need to go to a clinic every three months for injections. There is some suggestion that bones can be weakened if used for a long period of time. Does not protect against STIs.</p>

									<tab-heading>Emergency contraception ('morning after' pill)</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>A pill that can be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.</p>
										<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Back-up option if you forget to use protection or if a condom breaks. Can be sourced from your GP or without a prescription from most pharmacies.</p>
										<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Needs to be taken as soon as possible. This is a back-up that shouldn't replace using regular contraceptive methods. Nausea is a possible side-effect. Does not protect against STIs.</p>

									<tab-content>
										<p>Swap gloves between touching a partner's genitals and your own to prevent body fluids from mixing. Popular for lesbian and queer sex.</p>
										<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cheap and easy to find. Protects cuts on your hands too.</p>
										<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can be a bit awkward at first, but easy once you get used to it. Just find gloves of the right size and material for you.</p>

								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>Internal condoms</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>A cylinder-shaped barrier that goes inside the vagina or anus.</p>

								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>PEP</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>If you think you have been exposed to HIV you can take a course of PEP medication to prevent you from getting infected with the virus.</p>
										<p><strong>Pros:</strong> A good back-up option that is effective if started within 72 hours of exposure.</p>
										<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You need to go to a hospital or sexual health clinic to access PEP. Needs to be taken correctly for several weeks. Does not offer protection from other STIs.</p>

								<tab-item>
									<tab-heading>PrEP</tab-heading>
									<tab-content>
										<p>Medication you take every day to prevent you from getting HIV if you are exposed to the virus.</p>
										<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Puts you in charge. Don't need to rely on remembering a condom in the moment (although PrEP won't protect you from other STIs).</p>
										<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some side-effects. You have to remember to take your medication daily.</p>

I try to use condoms every time, but I'm also on PrEP, so that's my back-up if I forget or don't have a condom on me. I get STI-tested every few months.</opinion>
								<opinion name="Christina has an IUD fitted" img-src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/435/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/sxh_1_20_img2.png" img-alt="Young female student">I wanted something I didn't have to think about every day. I got an IUD because they prevent pregnancy for several years. I'm not too worried about STIs since I've been with my boyfriend for a couple of years now. I haven't had an STI test for a while, but I'm planning to get one soon to make sure I haven't got any asymptomatic infections.</opinion>
								<opinion name="Martine uses barriers" img-src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/435/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/sxh_1_20_img3.png" img-alt="Female student">I don't have a regular partner at the moment, and am enjoying the single life. When I hook up with women I usually try and use disposable gloves and condoms on toys. I've used a dental dam before, but not often. I get tested a couple of times a year. </opinion>

I'd like to have another one, but I'm waiting until I finish my studies. I use the contraceptive ring to prevent pregnancy for the moment. It's pretty easy; I just insert and forget about it for three weeks.</opinion>
								<opinion name="Cameron doesn't have sex very often" img-src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/435/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/sxh_1_20_img5.png" img-alt="Male student">I'm not really interested in sex, it's just not a big deal for me. I have a partner, and we're very loving and affectionate, although we rarely have sex. When we are sexual together we use condoms if we're doing penetration.</opinion>
								<opinion name="Florence is waiting until she's married to have sex" img-src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/435/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/sxh_1_20_img6.png" img-alt="Female student, dressed conservatively but not obviously from one religion">I got engaged during the last semester break. I'm looking forward to being sexual with my husband when we get married. We want to enjoy our time together as a couple before having children, so I'm going to see my doctor about going on the pill. </opinion>
								<opinion name="Felipe uses condoms" img-src="https://courses.epigeum.com/materials/platform/435/course_files/images/activity_images/course_specific/sxh_1_20_img7.png" img-alt="Young male student">I've just started using dating apps after the end of a two-year relationship. I haven't hooked up with anyone new yet. I want to use protection when I do, but I haven't used condoms for a while... I'm a bit worried I'll lose my erection. I picked up some from the student health service and I'll try putting some on by myself to see how they feel.</opinion>
