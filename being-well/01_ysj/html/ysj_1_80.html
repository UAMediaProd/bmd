							<p>In this module you have considered student life as a journey of changes and challenges. You
								have identified your own current position on the student journey, and considered some of the
								emotional challenges you are facing. You have considered the different aspects of personal
								identity and how your identity might be shaped on the student journey. And you have learnt
								about a number of strategies and skills for supporting your adaptability and building your
								sense of confidence and belonging. </p>
							<p>Now you have an opportunity to make a list of the ideas and strategies that feel most
								relevant to you in your current stage on the journey.</p>

							<instructional-text>
								<p>Use the grid to set one or two intentions for each of the suggested categories. For example, for a communication skill you could put: 'Saying "No thanks" when I don't want to join in the next round of drinks at the pub.' When you have made your list, click for some feedback about how to follow up on your intentions.</p>

								<p>You are much more likely to make changes if you capture your ideas in the form of concrete 'implementation intentions', which identify specific actions to be undertaken in specific contexts. It is also useful to include repetitions of a plan in order to help you build a new habit. For example, "On the first day back at university after the summer holiday I will go to the library to find a good place to set up my study base. I will go back there every day for two weeks, even if it is only for ten minutes."</p>
								<p>Or "In week two of semester I will sign up to one of the student clubs to meet new people and engage in events. I will make sure that I contact a member each fortnight through social media to expand my network of friends."</p>

								<p>Remember that you are much more likely to act on these applications of your learning if you capture your ideas in the form of concrete 'implementation intentions', which identify specific actions to be undertaken in specific contexts. It is also useful to include repetitions of a plan in order to help you build a new habit. For example, "On the first day back at university after the summer holiday I will go to the library to find a good place to set up my study base.
