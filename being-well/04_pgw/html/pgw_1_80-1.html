							<!-- ACTIVITY START -->
							<checklist>
								<check-item>It is common for students to feel a rollercoaster of emotions during their studies, and there will be periods of heightened stress and anxiety around deadlines. These will pass!</check-item>
								<check-item>Postgraduate students experience many demands on their time, and it is important to try to find a balance between studies and home life so you don't feel overstretched</check-item>
								<check-item>Imposter syndrome is incredibly common amongst postgraduate students, and sharing experiences with others can help you to realise you are not alone</check-item>
								<check-item>There can be barriers that make it more difficult to form social connections during postgraduate study, but these relationships are beneficial for your sense of wellbeing and can help you to achieve study success</check-item>
								<check-item>The research student-supervisor relationship can be complex, and it is important that you feel empowered and supported by these interactions. There are codes of conduct in place and steps you can take if you feel you cannot work well with your supervisor</check-item>
								<check-item>Whilst postgraduate research can feel isolating on occasions, there are communities of students around you and you can all support each other when you find you are struggling. Just having a coffee with a fellow student can be a great way of not feeling so isolated</check-item>
								<check-item>Don't forget that you need to take care of your physical and mental health and wellbeing as a priority &ndash; eating well, exercising regularly, having positive social interactions and doing things unrelated to your research will all help. And you'll find you'll be more productive and motivated for your research as a result!</check-item>
