							<p>When someone hurts themselves there is often a 'build-up' to the injury itself; a building intensity of feelings that reaches a point where the person feels that they must self-harm to cope. For some, this build-up might be over days or even weeks, whereas, for others, it can take just a matter of hours or minutes. Others may find it difficult to notice a build-up of feelings at all. This depends on a number of things, including:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>The nature and cause of the feelings</li>
									<li>Whether the person is able to recognise feelings early enough to use coping strategies</li>
									<li>How dissociated &ndash; or 'numb' &ndash; the person is. People often have a
										psychological 'cut-off point', where feelings that are overwhelming are shut off to help
										us cope. The more we experience this, the greater level of feeling we might have to
										experience to reconnect with ourselves.</li>
								</ul>

									<segment-content>This is the stage of self-harm itself. Usually after harming
										themselves, the person will experience a period of calm and a slow move back to
										stage one, with no thoughts of harming, or only fleeting ones, until a trigger occurs
										to start the process again. The sense of calm can happen because when we self-harm
										our body releases endorphins &ndash; the body's natural painkiller that can leave
										us feeling temporarily at ease, or elated. Then, the pressure not to repeat the action can, paradoxically, lead to the cycle repeating as the person puts themselves under
										pressure not to 'relapse'. Talking to someone to seek help and guidance can make a
										difference in reducing this pressure.</segment-content>

							<p>Without understanding the role self-harm has in enabling some people to cope with overwhelming feelings, it is harder to find alternative, less harmful ways of seeking self-support. As we have seen, the act of self-harming usually happens as part of a process. If we can gain insight into the process, we can then begin to find ways of stopping it from progressing, or interrupt the flow before it reaches its peak.</p>
