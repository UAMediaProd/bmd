							<p>Alcohol is the most commonly consumed recreational drug in the world. It can be fun if you
								know how to consume it in a sustainable and enjoyable way, but according to experts, alcohol
								is actually the most harmful recreational drug if we take into account the social and
								individual harm that it can cause.</p>
							<p>We can divide the risks of alcohol into immediate and long-term. The immediate risks include
								<strong>psychological</strong>, <strong>physical</strong>, <strong>social</strong>, <strong>legal</strong> and <strong>economic negative consequences</strong>.</p>
							
							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Because alcohol alters the way we think, make judgements and behave, we can easily do or say things that we regret, which can be life-altering. Drunk decisions might negatively affect a relationship with a partner, friends or family</li>
									<li>People often misjudge situations and get clumsy when drunk, so the chances of having an accident are high. Drinking and driving not only increases the chances of an accident, but you may get a penalty, need to pay a large fine or even be given a prison sentence
									</li>
									<li>When drunk, judgement and priorities change. The way drunk people might treat a space could damage the environment, get them into trouble or have a negative effect on a relationship (e.g. littering, stealing property, etc.)</li>
									<li>Aggressiveness and tendencies towards violence can increase with alcohol, so people may be more likely to engage in altercations or criminal behaviour that can have legal implications</li>
									<li>Finally, forcing others to drink and humiliating them (hazing or initiation activities) could be detrimental to developing new friendships and could harm existing ones. Furthermore, these types of activities can get you into serious trouble with your university, and even the police. </li>
								</ul>

											<p>Students live on a budget, and spending too much money can be a concern on a night out. Small tricks like getting cash out and leaving your bank card at home can really help. Are you paying with your phone? Set a budget limit for the night! Be aware, drinking cheap might ruin your night. Pace yourself and remember to drink water.</p>

											<p>Alcohol lowers our inhibitions. Therefore, we are more prone to doing things that we wouldn't normally do. Try to avoid using your phone when you're drinking. If you feel like sending messages or posting on social media, double-check with your friends that it is appropriate. If you do send an inappropriate message, be honest with the people involved and try to resolve the situation.

										</ctvm-question>
										<ctvm-feedback>
											<p>Again, lowered inhibitions play tricks on us. Many times, people get into embarrassing situations because they drink too much too quickly, or are not in the right mindset. Ask yourself (and your friends) how you (they) are feeling before you start drinking. If you are feeling down, angry, or just not in the right mindset, consider taking a break from drinking.</p>

											<p>If you are in the wrong mindset when you start drinking, the negativity

											<p>Alcohol leads to poor coordination. Pace your drinking, especially if you are feeling dizzy and clumsy. If someone shows any of the following signs or symptoms, they will probably need an ambulance: irregular or slow breathing, pale or blue-tinged skin (remember that this is less visible the darker the pigment of the skin), low body temperature, being unresponsive, passing out and being unconscious. Don't hesitate to call an ambulance if someone needs it, nobody will get in trouble.</p>

											<p>Alcohol impairs the brain's ability to create memories. Memories start getting blurry after a couple of drinks. The more you drink the more likely you are to have gaps in your memory (black-out) and the longer these gaps will be. Black-outs can be very disconcerting. To reduce the risk of a black-out, keep within recommended limits, and don't drink on an empty stomach or when sleep-deprived. Binge drinking results in black-outs more easily, so pace yourself and drink plenty of water.</p>

							<p>We've looked at some of the immediate risks when drinking alcohol, and how to minimise them.
								It's also worth thinking about the longer-term risks of alcohol dependence and looking out
								for the warning signs.</p>
							<p>Frequent and excessive alcohol intake is a silent killer. In Australia alone, there are nearly 6,000 deaths linked to alcohol every year (Lensvelt, E. <em>et al.</em>, 2018). These are deaths in which alcohol use is thought to be a direct contributing factor.</p>

									<node-heading>Long-term effects of alcohol</node-heading>
									<node-content>The more alcohol you drink the higher the risk of developing long-term issues. Alcohol can contribute to the development of many sorts of cancers. Additionally, it is damaging to the cardiovascular and digestive system and can have a negative impact on mental health and wellbeing.</node-content>
								</central-concept>
								<concept-nodes>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Liver disease</node-heading>
										<node-content>In Australia, around 16% of deaths due to alcohol are caused by liver disease. Men are more affected than women. The liver is a key organ in digestion and detoxification of the blood. In alcoholic liver disease, excess fat builds up in the liver, which leads to liver malfunction and inflammation.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Cancer</node-heading>
										<node-content>Cancer is responsible for the most alcohol related deaths in Australia (36%). Cancer is uncontrolled cell growth in a specific body tissue. Alcohol is considered a carcinogen for humans, which means that it can contribute to the development of cancer. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of getting cancers of mouth, throat, bowel, pancreas and of breast cancer in women. The more you drink the higher the chances, but even light, frequent drinkers may have higher odds than people who never drink.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders</node-heading>
										<node-content>When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it passes to the foetus through the placenta. Alcohol can have long-lasting physical and psychological effects on babies. Babies may also show alcohol withdrawal symptoms when they are born. Australian guidelines recommend that women who are pregnant, or thinking about becoming pregnant, do not drink at all.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Mental health</node-heading>
										<node-content>Alcohol induces a feeling of relaxation and cheerfulness. While this sensation might help to relieve stress temporarily, drinking habitually to numb stress increases the chances of developing alcohol dependence. Additionally, some people drink alcohol to self-medicate mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Drinking alcohol makes these conditions worse in the long-term.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Heart disease</node-heading>
										<node-content>Drinking alcohol can increase the risk of having a heart attack or a stroke in a number of ways, including raising blood pressure. Drinking alcohol also contributes to weight gain and the risk of developing diabetes, which weakens the cardiovascular system.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Alcohol dependence</node-heading>
										<node-content>Alcohol dependence is when someone has built up a physical and/or psychological reliance on alcohol, and finds it difficult to go without it. In Australia, around 2.2% of men and 0.8% of women are thought to be dependent on alcohol (World Health Organization, 2016). Genetic, psychological, developmental (e.g. stressful upbringings), environmental, and economic factors can contribute to the development of alcohol dependence. Ongoing self-medication after a stressful or traumatic event can also lead to dependence over time.</node-content>
