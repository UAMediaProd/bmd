							<p>Student life often involves balancing study, work, exercise and a social life. So, keeping up the energy to do everything is essential. Food provides the energy to fuel all these tasks, so it is important to eat <em>well</em> and to eat <em>regularly</em>. To get the most energy out of your diet, aim to:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Have three main meals and a few nutritious snacks every day to sustain your energy levels. Regular eating helps prevent feeling overly hungry, which can lead to overeating</li>
									<li>Try to include foods from all the food groups in your main meals to balance your intake</li>
									<li>Choose snacks wisely to boost your nutrition (fruit and vegetables are great, as are grains, nuts and dairy products)</li>
									<li>Try to avoid too many energy stimulants, such as coffee, energy drinks and sweets, as relying on these for energy is not a sustainable long-term practice. On the contrary, excessive consumption of energy stimulants may contribute to health issues, such as heart problems, anxiety, sleeping problems, or tooth erosion.</li>

									<pod-quote>I had such a busy schedule, running from lectures to my part-time job, and then catching up with friends in the evenings. I found it hard to fit in proper meals, and would often grab a can of Coke or a packet of crisps to keep me going, rather than stop to eat properly. I noticed that my skin was looking really dull and I was getting acne on my chin, which wasn't something I'd had since my teens. I decided to focus more carefully on what I was eating, and now I do bulk cooking at the weekends to make sure I have something nutritious and filling to eat when things get hectic during the week! I've noticed big improvements in my skin, and I feel like I have more energy and focus as well.</pod-quote>

Usually, she doesn't have any breakfast; she has a honey sandwich made from home for lunch; and she has a take-away curry or pizza for dinner. She snacks on muesli bars and nuts.

										Sahara is doing really well with her studies and is trying her best to adjust to living on her own. She is eating regularly during the day. However, she could do the following to improve her diet:
										<text-block>
											<ul>
												<li>Eat breakfast. Research shows that eating breakfast is vital for our physical and academic performance</li>
												<li>Ensure she eats a wide variety of foods. For example, she could have a piece of fruit or a pot of yoghurt as a snack</li>

									<action-question>
										Research shows that many students who have just left home struggle with adjusting to living on their own. Sahara could try a few strategies to help her navigate the way to better eating habits:
										<text-block>
											<ul>
												<li>Allocate a few minutes each week to plan her eating. For example, she could draft a two-week meal and snack planner that would help her ensure she is eating a wide variety of foods from all the food groups (i.e., fruit and vegetables, starchy carbohydrates, proteins, dairy and alternatives, and oils)</li>
												<li>Brainstorm some ideas with her housemates ideas for cooking meals together. When it comes to food and eating, sharing knowledge, skills and traditions is a great way to enjoy new foods</li>
												<li>Explore takeaway options based on wholegrains, vegetables and lean proteins (e.g. brown rice sushi, vegetable kebabs, or chicken and salad wraps and sandwiches).</li>

									<action-question>Karim is into the third year of his studies. He lives on his own. He is not the best cook, but he's learnt some simple healthy recipes that he can put together, and usually has freshly prepared or frozen home-cooked meals. For breakfast, he often has a cup of coffee and wholegrain toast. Lately, he's been exercising a lot and finding that he is getting hungry well before lunch, so he grabs a milkshake or small fries from the cafeteria at university. Karim thinks about having something additional for breakfast, but would like it to be quick and easy. What could be a good idea?</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="8">Pre-cooked boiled eggs or tinned baked beans or canned fish to add to the toast</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="9">Yoghurt and fruit</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<!--Feedback Karim-->
								<action-panel panel="8" is-white-padded="true">
									<action-question>Either of these options is a good choice as these are sources of lean proteins, which should help Karim feel fuller for longer and stop him grabbing unhealthy snacks from the cafeteria. Sometimes, tinned vegetables have high amounts of added salt and sugar (which are used as preservatives and taste enhancers). Aim for products with no or low added salt and sugar.</action-question>

								<!--Feedback Karm-->
								<action-panel panel="9" is-white-padded="true">
									<action-question>Having a more nutritious breakfast based on carbohydrates and protein will help Karim sustain his energy until lunch. Natural yoghurt and fresh or tinned fruit are great and an easy addition to any meal, or a perfect snack on their own. These could be easily packed as healthy bites on the go too, decreasing temptation to spend money on sugary snacks. If opting for flavoured yoghurt or tinned fruits, check the added sugar content and keep it to 5g or less per 100g of food product. </action-question>

If you identified some areas for improvement, focusing on small steps to improve your eating habits will help you change your behaviours for the better. For example, if your main issues are with eating regularly, you could aim to plan and schedule your diary to include time for food preparation and eating.</p>
