							<p>Well done on completing this module. However, changing how you think about yourself is a little bit like learning a new language, and you would not expect to be fluent in Spanish by just completing one module. It takes effort to maintain a strong sense of confidence and self-esteem, and to know you can be resilient.</p>

									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>The activities and reflections in this module will help you to continue to take purposeful actions that will build your confidence, self-esteem and resilience. Use the strategies you have developed and practise these new skills. It will take time for you to embed these into your life and, unfortunately, they won't all work all the time. To be realistic and compassionate, you need to be mindful that there is no golden answer, but there are steps you can take to feel more in control. Come back to this module when you need to and remind yourself of what helps and familiarise yourself with the professional support available at the university.</p>

									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>Being compassionate to others often comes more naturally than being self-compassionate. Recognise how you speak and act with others and help them to challenge their own NATs. How you help others can also be applied to how you help yourself. It is a challenge to be self-compassionate but use the strategies in this module and make time to reflect on how well you are doing in creating more compassionate self-talk.</p>

									<ladder-label>Understanding the context</ladder-label>
									<ladder-number>1</ladder-number>
									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience are not fixed traits but are forever changing depending on the environment, the people around you and the situation you are in. You will now hopefully understand the importance of your self-talk, how you can challenge your NATs and be more compassionate to yourself. </p>
