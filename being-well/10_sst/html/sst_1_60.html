							<p>Whatever problems and difficulties you may be encountering, if you decide to make contact with university support services or other agencies, they will not judge you or think you are overreacting. They have probably helped people before with similar issues and can use that experience and expertise to guide you.</p>
							<p>Members of staff in support services may ask about self-harm or suicidal thoughts. While this may provoke some anxiety, it is important to be honest about your feelings as it will enable them to find the right sort of support for you. </p>

								<pod-modal-content>
									<p>When we are worried about a friend, we often hold back from talking to them about it, for fear of upsetting them or causing them more problems.  If we raise the issue sensitively and with empathy, it might create the opportunity for the person to talk about their problems, maybe for the first time. Asking for help is hard, so if a friend asks them it could help to start the conversation. It is important to remember not to try and 'fix' problems, nor be an amateur counsellor; rather a good friend who can signpost to other forms of help.</p>
									<p>Saying things like, "I've noticed you have seemed really down recently. I'm a good listener if you want to talk", or "You've seemed really low recently and I've noticed you have been hurting yourself. I'm not making any judgement, but just want to be here to help if I can" can help.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I walked past the counselling service for a year before I built up the courage to go inside; I really wished I had gone sooner. I thought they would think my problems were silly, but it wasn't like that at all &ndash; they really took me seriously.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Ben, 20</em></p>

									<pod-quote><p>I couldn't think of an answer to my problems, but talking it through with someone else really helped me think about it differently. They didn't judge me and helped me see the alternatives.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Anne-Marie, 32</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>It is easy to think that you are the only one who has ever felt like this and that no one could really understand.  As soon as I started talking to someone I quickly realised this wasn't the case and that made such a huge difference to me starting to be kinder to myself.</p></pod-quote>

										<node-content>
											<p>If it feels appropriate to your situation, there may be someone close to you who you can trust and who you feel will be able to listen. Tell them you don't necessarily need them to find answers, but rather you need them to listen to you without making any judgement.</p>

										<node-heading>University staff and peers</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Depending on your university, you may have been allocated a peer mentor to support you in your studies. They could be a good listening ear, drawing on their experience of supporting students and pointing them in the right direction of other services where they can get support. If you have built up a good relationship with a member of staff (e.g. lecturer, tutor, someone working in the library, careers or security teams), don't hesitate to ask them how best to seek support in the university; if they don't know themselves, they will know someone who does!</p>

										<node-heading>Counselling services</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Counselling services have been part of university support services for many years, and the counsellors are highly trained in being able to help with a wide range of problems, either supporting you individually, or perhaps in a group (depending on your needs). It can provide a great opportunity to not only understand your problems better, but also find different ways of coping in times of struggle.</p>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node class="marker7">
										<node-heading>Student health services</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Some universities have GPs available for students. Your GP can provide invaluable information, as well as medication if you need it, to support your mental health. Student health services also provide holistic support for mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
										</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Online support</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>Online support has grown in the recent years and there are some fantastic resources available. Some have to be paid for, but many are free for all to use. Some links to services are included on the <em>Resource bank</em> screen. There are also a number of peer support groups available on social media. It is best to be careful about which ones you sign up for &ndash; some offer very sensitive advice and support from others in similar situations, whereas others can offer information that makes things much worse. Some general advice: proceed with caution.</p>

										<node-heading>Telephone helplines</node-heading>
										<node-content>
											<p>In Australia, there are a range of established telephone helplines that can offer confidential support at times of difficulty. Healthdirect has a list of the main ones that have a mental health focus (see the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod). The people offering support are usually not counsellors, but are trained listeners who can give you an opportunity to talk through your problems and help you decide the next 'best steps' to take. Your university might also offer an out-of-hours crisis line that you can use.</p>

							<p>All support services work to a confidentiality policy. However, if a helper thinks that someone may be at risk of acting on suicidal thoughts, they may need to access other services for them. In exceptional cases, they may do this without the person's consent if they believe the risk is immediate, but they will always try to obtain consent first.</p>
							<p>Always remember that staff in student services are there to help and will always welcome you making contact with them; there is no need to struggle on in isolation.</p>
