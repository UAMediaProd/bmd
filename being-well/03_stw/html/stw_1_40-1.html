							<p>Having considered what procrastination is and how it might happen, it is important to think about what steps we can take to move beyond procrastination and make progress once again. The first step, of course, is being honest with yourself about what is happening. Too often we can convince ourselves that our procrastination is, in fact, not happening at all and putting things off is instead part of another grand plan!</p>
							<p>Procrastination can be particularly hard if we are spending long periods of time working on our own &ndash; such as writing a dissertation &ndash; as finding the motivation to keep going is more challenging. We can experience a repeating pattern of thoughts, which can be negative about ourselves or our abilities. The sooner we are able to recognise our procrastination, the quicker we can make use of self-support strategies &ndash; such as thinking of alternative, more positive internal messages &ndash; or seek help from someone else.</p>

							<p>Caitlin's situation might be one we can all relate to at times: being anxious about doing
								something so putting it off (procrastinating) as a way of feeling less anxious, only for
								things to get worse as time ticks on. As things do get worse, we can also experience other,
								associated problems, such as negative self-talk and negative comparing against others ("I
								bet everyone else has done theirs").</p>
							<p>What could Caitlin do differently to help support herself and manage her procrastination?</p>

											<p>Think about some of the reasons Caitlin may be procrastinating, such as a busy schedule or lack of confidence.</p>
										</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>
											<p>Procrastination can be directly related to study skills because of the skills we need at university &ndash; independent learning, sourcing information, note-taking and time management. It is important to recognise what you can do well already, and what you might need to improve on to study more effectively. For Caitlin, it might be fears of being judged harshly by her course mates or lecturers &ndash; feeling that she isn't as clever as other students in her group; anxieties about standing up and talking in front of others &ndash; are all playing a part in putting off doing her work. When we feel anxious our temptation is to do whatever we can to stop feeling anxious, which can often include avoiding the trigger situation in the first place. While this can lead to a temporary sense of relief, it almost always stores up more anxiety further down the line.</p>

Study skills sessions can be provided through different support programmes, and can help build confidence in managing work pressures so that procrastination can be minimised. Speaking with her tutors and lecturers can be an important step, as they can help reassure Caitlin or signpost her to other services &ndash; e.g. student services or online services such as Beyond Blue (see the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod).</p>

							<p>Procrastination can sometimes feel all-encompassing and it can be difficult to find a way
								out. It is important to recognise procrastination when it is happening, as that enables us to take some action. Whether procrastination comes from study skills issues, or other
								anxieties &ndash; or a mixture of both &ndash; there are some excellent support services
								available. Don't judge yourself harshly if you procrastinate; it is an experience shared by
								many and, with support and information, it is possible to make productive and positive
								changes. Procrastination and ways to deal with it are also explored in the module titled:
								<em>Am I good enough?</em></p>
