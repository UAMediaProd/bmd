							<p>As well as the basic cost to rent your accommodation, there will be a lot of other factors to consider. You may need to pay bills on top of your rent, if these are not covered in the standard rate, as well as buy items to furnish the home, such as pots and pans, bedding and curtains. By thinking about what you need to account for in addition to your rent, you will be able to work out how much your accommodation will actually cost.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Sort the items according to whether you have already included them in your budget, not included them, or whether they are included in your rent. Drag and drop each item into the appropriate column. Then click for feedback.</p></instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible><p>Consider the following items and categorise them based on if you have budgeted for the item or not, if it is included in your monthly rent or if it is not needed. Then continue for feedback.</p></instructional-text-accessible>
