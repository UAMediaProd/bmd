							<p>Whether planned or unplanned, finding out you're pregnant or that your partner is pregnant can bring up a lot of different emotions:</p>

							<div class="wordcloud" id="wordcloud-1">
								<li class="big">Surprise</li>
								<li>Confusion</li>
								<li class="small">Excitement</li>

								<li class="big">Joy</li>
							</div>

							<p>It can also bring up a lot of questions:</p>

							<ul class="big-bullets">
								<li>Is the pregnancy test correct?</li>
								<li>Am I ready to have a baby?</li>
								<li>What are my options if I want a termination?</li>
								<li>Will I need to take a break from studying?</li>
								<li>How will I manage my studies if I have a baby to look after?</li>

							<p>Everyone's circumstances and needs are different.</p>
							<p>If you were trying to get pregnant you may already have a plan to manage your studies around your pregnancy, childbirth and parenting. You may have already thought about who can help you with childcare and if you're going to take some time off study.</p>
							<p>If the pregnancy is unplanned it is likely you will have more questions and decisions to make. Support services within and outside the university can help you make a plan that is right for you.</p>

									<h4>Challenging circumstances</h4>
									<text-quote>
										<p>I separated from my husband halfway through my PhD candidature. A few months into the separation, I found out I was pregnant (I have PCOS, which causes very infrequent and irregular periods).</p>
										<p>When I told my husband about the pregnancy, he asked for the chance to repair the relationship. However, his continuing inappropriate marital conduct made this impossible.</p>
										<p>Leaving the relationship meant that I would have to cope with the physical and emotional demands of raising a child alone (especially during the newborn stage), and that I would face a certain degree of financial instability. At six months pregnant and without any justifiable medical reason, termination was not an option.</p>

									<h4>Coming to a decision</h4>
									<text-quote>
										<p>Faced with such a challenging situation, I knew I needed to seek out support and advice. I spoke to trusted friends, family, professionals (such as midwives, lawyers, psychologists and trauma counsellors), and mentors. I was overwhelmed by the level of support from friends and family &ndash; even from friends I hadn't spoken to in years due to my husband's influence. They were there for me at a time I needed help the most.</p>
										<p>I assessed my current financial standing against all possible options, and drew up a plan for how I could continue to support myself. I was also working part-time and the support from my colleagues, my line manager, and even our CEO, was vital. They provided flexible and safe working arrangements for me, and agreed a six-month maternity leave for when my daughter was born.</p>

									<h4>Continuing with my research</h4>
									<text-quote>
										<p>Raising a child alongside my other responsibilities has certainly not been easy; but continuing with my PhD gives a sense of structure and stability to my life. It is difficult to put into words how important continuing to study has been for my mental health and wellbeing.</p>
										<p>The continued support from my PhD supervisors has also been essential. They helped me to see that there was no reason why I couldn't finish my degree while also being a mother. My supervisors are both parents themselves, and one had two babies between her Honors and her PhD. Seeing other parents overcome similar challenges helped me to believe in myself, and strive for my goals.</p>

									<h4>Developing as a person, and as a parent</h4>
									<text-quote>
										<p>I truly believe that were it not for the love I have for my child, the immense support I have received from loved ones and colleagues, my faith, and healthy coping mechanisms, I would most likely have had to quit my degree during such a challenging year, and likely my job too.</p>
										<p>Instead, 12 months on, I am living peacefully in a beautiful neighbourhood, closer to friends, and I have submitted my first ever manuscript for publication. I am first author, and it has been accepted with only minor revisions.</p>
										<p>And most importantly, my baby daughter is happy, healthy, and doing very well. My research work is made more meaningful with the presence of my daughter in my life. I dedicate my work to her. I have renewed drive to finish my work, and finish it well. I am proud that I can demonstrate resilience, respect, equality, and the fruits of an authentic life.</p>

							<p>Decisions about how to navigate a pregnancy can be particularly difficult for women from a family or community background that has negative views towards unplanned pregnancy or sex before marriage. Whatever you need, you are not alone &ndash; there are support services to help you make the decision that is right for you.</p>
							<p>While it can feel overwhelming, the staff from these support services help people in the same situations and with the same questions every day. They are experienced at listening to your concerns and helping others in the same position, so do reach out.</p>
