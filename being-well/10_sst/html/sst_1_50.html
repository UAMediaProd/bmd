							<p>As we have discussed, self-harm follows a similar build-up process. The more we can understand the process we go through, the more opportunities we have to make changes and seek support at those different stages. It is very rare that someone self-harms without an earlier 'movement' towards that action.</p>

											<h3>Step 1</h3>
											<h4>Early external triggers of stress</h4>
											<p>
												Julia has been harming herself by picking her skin for several years, following a
												difficult breakdown of her parents' relationship. She was often caught in the middle
												of their arguments and felt torn between her loyalties to both. Julia experiences
												stress from external factors, such as an argument with friends or a looming
												assessment or coursework. Without her realising, this triggers an internal response,
												which is an increase in stress and a sense of being trapped.
											</p>
											<p><strong>Thinking about the external factors that trigger Julia's stress, why do you
												think they could cause her so much distress?</strong></p>
										</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>
											<p class="middle">Think about Julia's feelings of being trapped and the impact that might have.
											</p>
										</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>
											<p class="middle">It is very common for someone's self-harm to link back to, or be a reminder
												of, previous upsetting experiences. For Julia perhaps, her past feelings of
												being trapped in her parents' difficult divorce might return to her when she
												feels trapped in different situations now, triggering her self-harm.</p>
										</reflection-feedback>
									</reflection>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<reflection>
										<reflection-question>
											<h3>Step 2</h3>
											<h4>Feeling increasingly helpless</h4>
											<p>
												As Julia continues to feel stressed, these feelings become more obviously associated
												with times she felt like this before. Her feelings of stress then begin to trigger a
												sense of helplessness. When this happens, options of self-support for Julia become
												harder to identify.
											</p>
											<p><strong>As Julia begins to feel increasingly helpless, what steps might she be able
												to take to support herself?</strong></p>
										</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>
											<p class="middle">What self-help strategies have worked for you in the past that might work for
												Julia here?</p>
										</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>
											<p class="middle">Options of self-support for Julia might include writing a list of positive
												things that help, such as exercising, hobbies, distraction, mindfulness or
												breathing techniques that she could then refer to. Self-help strategies are
												explored more thoroughly in the module titled: <em>Stress, anxiety and
													depression</em>.</p>
										</reflection-feedback>
									</reflection>

								<process-page>
									<reflection>
										<reflection-question>
											<h3>Step 3</h3>
											<h4>Beginning to feel stuck and frightened</h4>
											<p>
												As the feelings of stress and helplessness build, Julia feels stuck &ndash; like a
												'rabbit in the headlights'. She doesn't know what to do, or where to turn. She
												remembers the relief she feels when she picks her skin and once the thought is
												planted in her mind, she feels increasingly drawn to do it. Again, at this stage
												Julia could refer to her self-support list of activities; or, she could talk to a
												trusted friend or a wellbeing worker based in the university.
											</p>
											<p><strong>If Julia is struggling to support herself using the strategies discussed
												previously, what might her next steps be?</strong></p>
										</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>
											<p class="middle">If her internal support strategies are not helping, what external strategies
												might Julia consider?</p>
										</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>
											<p class="middle">Self-support strategies are incredibly important but they might not always
												feel sufficient. At this stage talking to someone, either within the
												university, or using a telephone helpline or online resource (see the
												<em>Resource bank</em> screen for ideas), is a good step to take. Problems that feel
												caught in a loop in our own thought process often need talking through with
												someone else to help make better sense of them and break the cycle.</p>
										</reflection-feedback>
									</reflection>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<reflection>
										<reflection-question>
											<h3>Step 4</h3>
											<h4>Starts to self-harm</h4>
											<p>
												At this stage Julia struggles to find alternative ways of coping and feels
												overwhelmed by her feelings, and she begins to self-harm. She immediately notices
												a sense of relief. She also notices, however, a sense of shame, as she is
												disappointed in herself that she has "done it again". This makes Julia feel worse
												about herself and the relief is very short-term.
											</p>
											<p><strong>What might Julia be able to do now?</strong></p>
										</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>
											<p class="middle">Taking a self-compassionate approach is vital; how might she do that?</p>
										</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>
											<p class="middle">Self-blame and guilt are common feelings after someone has self-harmed, as
												they often feel disappointed in themselves. However, a self-compassionate
												approach is vital in helping Julia break this cycle. In understanding the
												process of self-harm and, if the cycle is to be broken, Julia needs
												to be supported to find more self-caring ways of expressing her feelings.
												Talking to someone about what happens is the best way forward, preferably a
												trained professional such as a counsellor. They will not judge and are very
												experienced in helping people find different ways of working through
												feelings.</p>

							<p>As we can see, while it is difficult to find ways of breaking into the build-up cycle, there
								are different points where someone might use strategies for self-support, which can divert
								the mind from self-harm. Stages are typically not followed in order or felt at equal levels
								of intensity. Sometimes different stages can be experienced much more quickly than others,
								or missed out completely. It is helpful, however, to have some sense of how self-harm can
								often occur as a build-up through different stages; the earlier stages are the best points
								at which to seek support.</p>
