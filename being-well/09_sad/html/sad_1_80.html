							<p>Being proactive about looking after yourself is one of the best things you can do to make stressful situations feel less overwhelming, minimise feelings of anxiety and help to manage your mood.</p>
							<p>Using some of the ideas that you have read about as a starting point, think about what activities, actions or adjustments to your daily routine might help to improve your sense of wellbeing at university. Then really try to work them into your everyday life.</p>
							
							<instructional-text><p>A few ideas have already been added to the list &ndash; if they are not relevant to you, you can delete them by clicking on the cross. Then write your first point and click on the 'Plus' symbol to reveal the next space. You can add up to six points of your own. If you write fewer than six points you must click on the 'Plus' symbol to ensure that your text is captured in the summary.</p></instructional-text>
