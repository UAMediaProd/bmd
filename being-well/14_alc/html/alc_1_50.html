							<p>We have talked about the inner motivations of people to drink alcohol. However, as we
								discussed at the beginning of this module, alcohol has a very strong social component.</p>
							<p>At university, you will be experiencing many new situations. Social life can be tough to
								navigate, especially at the beginning: you are out of your comfort zone and trying to find
								your place in a new context. Peer influence will likely play a key role in your life at
								university. This is not necessarily a bad thing. You might want to try new things. However,
								if you end up doing things that you don't want to purely to fit in, you're unlikely to enjoy
								the experiences. </p>

							<p>It is in no way compulsory to join in with drinking just because other students are, or because there are alcoholic drinks available. Some students choose not to drink at all, or rarely. This is becoming more common in Australia. There can be many reasons for this, from religious beliefs, to not liking the taste of alcohol, disliking the sensation of being drunk or not being in the mood to drink.</p>

							<p>There are often a lot of opportunities to drink alcohol at social events at the beginning and end of semester, for example:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>If you try a new student club or society, there may be free drinks at the start of semester functions</li>
									<li>Your new friends might want to check out a student night at a bar</li>
									<li>Some societies offer free drinks at start-of-semester functions</li>
									<li>Your department may host drinks to welcome new and returning students. </li>

									<p>If you choose to drink, think about how you could make social events more inclusive
										for students who prefer not to. Although they may be fine with you drinking, it's
										not always fun to be surrounded by drunk people on a night out. Some students may
										also feel excluded if social events often take place in venues such as pubs,
										especially if they prefer not to enter them for religious reasons.</p>
									<p>Think about arranging a day out to explore the local area or a movie night, and take a look at your students' association events calendar for ideas. Many clubs and societies now hold 'sober socials' so there should be lots of options to choose from.</p>

										<mcq-question>Your friends are deciding what alcohol to buy in the bottle shop. Last time you drank together, you had one bottle of wine plus a bottle of vodka. You are a group of four people including you. Two of them want to get the same amount of alcohol plus another bottle of wine, just in case. What should you do?</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>You haven't gone out in a while and want to celebrate something
													very special &ndash; end of exams! It is fine to drink more than usual.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>You haven't gone out in a while and your body and mind are not
													used to the effects of alcohol. You should not drink as much as usual.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>Many students choose to celebrate the end of exams by going out for
											drinks. If you have been studying a lot, it is likely that you have not been
											going out as often and your alcohol intake has been low. This means that your
											body has a reduced alcohol tolerance and is not used to processing high amounts
											of alcohol. You will therefore need to drink less alcohol than usual to feel
											drunk. Be extra careful if you feel your tolerance may be lowered.
										</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>You finished studying today at 5pm. You went straight to a footy match with your friends and started drinking beers. You haven't eaten anything since lunchtime, and are not sure whether to stop for dinner. How should you proceed?</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>It is probably a good idea to take a break from drinking and
													have some food. You might be sick if you continue drinking on an empty
													stomach.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>It is probably a good idea to not eat anything. You also need
													less alcohol on an empty stomach to get drunk and beers are expensive in
													the stadium.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>Drinking on an empty stomach is not a good idea. If there is no food in the stomach to help absorb the alcohol, it reaches the small intestine much more quickly, where it is rapidly absorbed into the body. This means the effects of alcohol are felt more intensely. The hangover after drinking on an empty stomach is usually more unpleasant, too. Try to never drink on an empty stomach!</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>You are back in your student accommodation. You have finished your
											exams and your friends want to get you really drunk so you can enjoy your
											freedom and forget about exams. They dare you with a drinking challenge that you don't like the idea of. How should you respond?
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Say that you aren't keen on playing, and suggest a different
													game so you are all happy with the rules.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Agree to play &ndash; they only want you to have fun and
													celebrate
													the end of exams.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>Your friends influence your decisions, in the same way that you impact their thoughts and actions. But you don't need to do anything that you don't want to do just because others are pressuring you. If you are not entirely happy about the idea of drinking that shot or downing a drink, it is likely to have some negative consequences that night or the following day.</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>Your group of friends is on the way to a club. However, one of them
											looks too drunk. They stand up but they fall over and hurt themselves. They say
											they are OK and want to come with you. Is it a good idea?
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Yes, if you tell them they should go home they will feel
													offended and humiliated. They will probably sober up on the way to the
													club and be fine.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>No, they have probably drunk too much too quickly. They are not
													in the best physical and mental state to go to the club.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>We know that alcohol causes dizziness and a lack of coordination. People are able to control their bodies well enough when reasonably drunk. So, visible incoordination and falling over are signs of being too drunk. If your friend is this drunk from pre-drinking, it is likely that they will not enjoy the night out, and may even put themselves in danger. It is better for them to rest and go out on another day. There is the whole summer to celebrate!</mcq-feedback>

									<mcq>
										<mcq-question>You are out for dinner with friends and everyone has had a few glasses of wine. One of them brought their car, as the restaurant that you are at is a bit far and public transport takes ages. Some of your friends think it is a good idea to take the car as it's now quite late, but you are not fully convinced. How should you react?</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Get in the car. The owner of the car doesn't look that drunk and it's only a 20-minute drive.</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Suggest that the group gets a taxi, and be firm about this choice. It will be safer and the trip will be inexpensive split between everyone. </mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>More than 150 people are killed on Australian roads every year due to drink-driving (Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development, 2018). Alcohol makes you uncoordinated and dizzy, and it blurs your vision. These all impair the ability to drive safely, which is why drink-driving is so dangerous. Moreover, young drivers (18-24 years old) have the most drink-driving accidents and deaths. They are not only less experienced at driving, but they may be more susceptible to peer pressure and ignore traffic rules.</mcq-feedback>

										<mcq-question>You and your friends are in the club. Everything is going well, until
											you go to the smoking area and one of your friends sees her ex-partner leaving
											with someone else. She's had a lot to drink and is very upset and starts crying.
											How should you react?
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>Distract her and invite her to do a shot so she can forget about
													it quickly and keep having fun.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Find a quiet spot and ask if she wants to talk about it.
													Listen carefully and consider taking her home if she doesn't seem to
													be feeling better.
												</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>
										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>It is always better to express emotions rather than keeping them
											bottled up. Alcohol increases emotional volatility, and psychological stress can
											come out in unexpected ways. It's OK to be down from time to time. Talk to
											your friends and get home safely.

							<p>Given all the positive and negative effects of alcohol that we have discussed, we suggest these simple tips to nurture a healthy drinking culture for yourself and those around you:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Check in with friends and ask each other how you are feeling before starting to
										drink
									</li>
									<li>When reminiscing about a night out, think about alcohol intake and if it had a positive or negative impact</li>
									<li>Limit heavy drinking to special occasions and encourage friends to do the same</li>
									<li>Keep track of the number of standard drinks you have when you drink &ndash; remember the guidelines are no more than 4 on any one day and no more than 10 a week.</li>
								</ul>
							</text-block>

							<p>We have covered a lot about alcohol in this module, from the biology to the social aspects of
								drinking. We hope that you now are better equipped to have a healthy relationship with
								alcohol. It will come naturally for some people and others might struggle a bit. No matter
								what type of person you are, keep an eye on your drinking and that of others.</p>
