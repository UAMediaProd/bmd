							<p>Making friends is often what new students say is their top priority to help them settle in
								and feel like they belong. New housemates and classmates offer great opportunities to find
								people you get on with, but there are lots of other options for meeting people and expanding
								your social network at every stage of the student journey. </p>

										<p>I know everyone always says about joining clubs and societies, and I dismissed
											this at first, as I thought that the meetings would go on late in the evenings
											or would be on days when I didn't have lectures, so wouldn't want to pay the
											train fare to come to campus specially. But someone on my course mentioned the
											Ultimate Frisbee club, and I just pushed myself to give it a go and I am so glad
											I did. They were really friendly and welcoming, even though I am not very sporty
											and my hearing impairment does hamper my effectiveness on the field &ndash; they
											have got teams for every level, and it is mainly about getting a bit of exercise
											and having fun. And they try to be very flexible with the timings for the social
											events, so everyone can be accommodated.</p>

										<p>When I first started my PhD, I was just focused on getting my head around all the
											new requirements and getting stuck into my research. But, after a while of just
											spending hours in the library, I started to feel really isolated. I made an
											effort to attend some of the events at the graduate school, and exchanged
											numbers with some of the other PhD students there. Even though we are all
											researching completely different things, we have found it really helpful to meet
											up regularly for coffee and share the ups and downs of our research experience.

							<p>Most people feel a bit anxious about meeting new people, and it can feel more difficult if you are naturally shy or introverted. Try not to be too self-critical or overthink what to say.</p>
							<p>Some suggestions on how to reach out to others:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Join online groups to meet fellow students before you arrive. You could ask if anyone
										wants to meet up to walk to induction sessions together or is interested in similar
										clubs or societies</li>
									<li>In a new class or when working with a new group, introduce yourself to the person next to you. You could ask what interested them in the course, or how they are finding the introduction activities so far</li>
									<li>If you're living in shared accommodation, knock on the doors of your new housemates to introduce yourself, find out what they are
										studying and where they are from</li>
									<li>Look out for taster sessions to try out new activities. It can be easier with company,
										so you could agree with someone else that you will go with them to the events they are
										interested in, if they come with you to yours!</li>
									<li>Sign up for any buddy schemes or mentoring for new students.</li>
								</ul>
							</text-block>

							<p>Try to avoid making assumptions about how other people are feeling, as people often look more confident than they feel. Most people will be grateful when someone else makes the first move to talk to them.</p>
