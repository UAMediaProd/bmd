									<p>You can support others wanting to get a good night's sleep by being sensitive about noise and disturbance. If you share a bedroom with someone, then talk together about the sorts of sleep conditions that you both want to develop. Try out some of each other's ideas, and then reach a compromise that you can both benefit from.</p>

							<p>No one can <em>make</em> themselves sleep well &ndash; in fact, lying there worrying about not sleeping is only likely to make it worse! We all have times when we just can't sleep. But everyone can make changes to help create the right conditions for sleeping.</p>
							<p>The environment in which you sleep is vital to ensuring you get the best possible rest. There are a number of adjustments you can make to your living space and routine to improve the quality of your sleep. If you share a bedroom, say with a sibling or a partner, you can find ways to adapt some of these techniques, and reach an accommodation that works for both of you.</p>

							<p>Sleep is an important aspect of staying well. Just like food and exercise, it is part of what your body and mind need in order to deal positively with the demands of each day. No one sleeps perfectly all the time, so don't stress over it if you have a few bad nights. Do see whether any of these tips work for you, and if the problem continues for a month or more then consider seeking advice from your GP.</p>
