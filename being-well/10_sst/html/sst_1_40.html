							<p>At a time of crisis, there are essentially two ways of finding support: our own internal self-care strategies (things we can do to support ourselves), and external support strategies (people and agencies who can help us cope). With the help of self-care strategies and our external support system, we can develop a <glossary content="A written plan of action detailing support options for when someone feels very low or suicidal.">safety plan</glossary> to use generally at times of stress, but specifically at crisis points.  </p>

							<!-- ACTIVITY START -->
							<flashcards class="with-images">
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Exercise to feel good</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">Doing exercise is not only good for us physically, but it also releases endorphins, which are sometimes known as 'natural mood lifters'. This can help to break a cycle of self-harm or reduce suicidal thoughts. Even gentle exercise is beneficial when you are feeling low.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">STOPP technique</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">
										<p>A really useful self-help approach to structure our thinking in response to particular situations is the STOPP technique: </p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>S: STOP</strong> &ndash; Pause for a moment </li>
											<li><strong>T: TAKE A BREATH</strong> &ndash; Pay attention to your breathing </li>
											<li><strong>O: OBSERVE</strong> &ndash; Notice the types of thoughts you are having or any other sensations you feel </li>
											<li><strong>P: PERSPECTIVE</strong> &ndash; Think how might you support yourself right now, e.g. think what advice would you give to a friend </li>
											<li><strong>P: PRACTISE</strong> &ndash; Use self-care strategies and review how they work for you.</li>
										</ul>
									</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Be kind to yourself</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">Taking a deliberate approach to speaking kindly and compassionately to ourselves in times of difficulty. We are probably too quick to self-criticise, whereas repeating self-supporting phrases &ndash; as we might encourage a friend in crisis &ndash; can really help. Supportive phrases could include: "I'm sorry it's so tough for you right now", and it might help to gently stroke your arms, or hold a soothing soft object such as a pillow.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Distraction techniques</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">Distraction can be an important way of supporting ourselves. This is when you do something to take your attention away from difficult thoughts or feelings, such as carrying out an activity or watching a film. If used all the time, of course, it can contribute to ongoing problems, as we never allow ourselves to deal with how we feel. Used carefully, however, distraction can be a useful short-term support strategy.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Practise mindfulness</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">Mindfulness strategies can help us focus on the here and now rather than getting hooked on to negative or upsetting thinking, which are often associated with suicidal thinking or self-harm. This can include journaling, swimming or practising yoga. See the module titled: <em>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience</em> for more information on overcoming negative thoughts.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Seeking support</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">Telling ourselves that we have to do everything on our own is both unrealistic and unreasonable. We all need the help of others on occasion. Perhaps make a commitment to yourself that you will give talking to someone else a try and see what it is like.</flashcard-back>

									<p>Exercise can offer huge benefits at times of emotional difficulty, as it releases hormones that can lift our mood. Why not take a look at what facilities are available in the university and consider if you might want to make use of them as part of your self-support approach?</p>

							<p>Different things work for different people. It may be some of the suggested strategies also work for you, or perhaps it sparked your thinking about different things that work. Even if you are unable to draw up a long list at this stage, identifying one or two things that might work is an important start. Often, for a wellbeing plan, it is a case of developing a 'good enough' starting point and then reviewing it on a weekly basis, building it up over time.</p>

							<p>How easy was it to decide on strategies that might work for you? Is there a pattern between those strategies that immediately appeal to you, and those you are less likely to use, such as doing vs. thinking strategies? It can be hard to 'get going' with self-support strategies because, when you are feeling really low, finding the energy to do so is difficult. Once the first step is made, however, it is amazing how quickly some momentum can build. Repeating strategies, and trying out new ones, will become easier over time.</p>
