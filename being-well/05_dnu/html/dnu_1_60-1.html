							<p>As well as the impact on your finances, we know that ready meals are often higher in fat and salt content, and lower in other nutrients. It's also  difficult to know the nutritional content of many takeaway choices. When you are living on a student budget, you might find that, once you know how, cooking for yourself can be a cheaper and healthier option.</p>

								<p>Cooking for yourself every day may seem overwhelming, but ultimately it allows you to make smarter choices over your portion sizes and ingredients. With a few staple items, you can recreate your favourite takeaway-style meals at home. Batch cooking could save you time and money, and supermarket shortcuts, such as pasta sauces and curry powders, are readily available to help you out.</p>
								<p>Simplicity is the key and getting into a routine that works for you is the first step.</p>

							<p>A great way to eat more healthily and save money is to prepare and cook your own food, if you can (check the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod to learn some tips for eating well on a budget). Cooking for yourself means you can be more in control of your choices, for example checking the food miles of the ingredients, buying local or seasonal if possible, or perhaps choosing to consume fewer animal products for environmental reasons.</p>
							<p>Preparing your own food also means that you can choose your favourite ingredients and cook them exactly how you like them. Cooking with family, friends or housemates also helps to build your knowledge and skills, increases confidence, and supports positive attitudes and personal relationships (Mills, S. <em>et al.</em>, 2017). </p>

								<opinion name="Robin tries to reduce his food waste" img-src="../images/activity_images/course_specific/dnu_1_60_img1_aus.png" img-alt="Reducing food waste"><p><text-quote>I focus on the fresh foods (vegetables, dairy, etc.) I'll need for the next few days and write a shopping list. It's important to me to reduce food waste, so I think about how I can use ingredients in a few different meals. I also keep a good stock of canned, frozen and packaged foods that are low in sugar and salt. These are good to bulk out meals or for days when I can't be bothered to run to the shops.</text-quote></p></opinion>
								<opinion name="Natasha buys groceries with her housemates" img-src="../images/activity_images/course_specific/dnu_1_60_img2.png" img-alt="Group shopping"> <p><text-quote>I never go grocery shopping when I'm hungry! I end up just grabbing things from the shelf I don't need, and it's usually not the healthiest foods. My housemates and I eat together a few times a week, so we'll often go shopping together and share the food bill. This means we can buy in bulk, which is generally cheaper, and we get to practise our cooking and try out new recipes on each other.</text-quote></p></opinion>
								<opinion name="Sofia is an international student who finds comfort in familiar foods" img-src="../images/activity_images/course_specific/dnu_1_60_img3.png" img-alt="Adjusting to a new culture"> <p><text-quote>When I first started studying here, I found it difficult &ndash; moving away from home to another country, starting uni, and looking after myself for the first time in my life! Food has always been a big comfort for me, so I was worried when I went to the supermarket and couldn't find my favourite foods. My friends in the International Society tipped me off about which shops have a good range of international foods, so I stock up on familiar snacks and ingredients whenever I can! I've also got more confident trying out new styles of cooking and enjoy trying out local restaurants with friends.</text-quote></p></opinion>

									<pod-quote>I look for promotions, special deals, and coupons to save money on groceries. A bit of homework goes a long way for my food budget!</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Natalie, 26</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>Just before closing time, many shops discount fresh produce like bread or other baked goods. It's a great time to stock up and you can get expensive foods for a fraction of the price.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Thomas, 45</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>Me and my housemates have one night of the week as leftovers night. Last night we had a meal made of leftover baked vegetables, cooked rice, cheese and boiled eggs &ndash; delicious, cheap and no waste.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Ahmad, 29</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>A lot of my course friends are very eco-friendly and so this got me thinking about how I can help to reduce food waste. One of them used a food waste app back home so I did my research and downloaded a few too.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Chloe, 18</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>Of course, preparing meals and eating together is cheaper and easier, but I eat halal and wasn't sure if this is something I could do with my housemates. I am glad I was brave enough to discuss this as everyone is happy to accommodate my preferences. We don't share all of the meals, but we do cook and eat together when we can.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Hajara, 24</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>I still live at home and am responsible for preparing one dinner per week (including buying the ingredients and cooking). One trick I've learnt is that, if you substitute 50% of the meat in a recipe (such as spag bol) with legumes, it becomes a much cheaper and more environmentally friendly meal!</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Ned, 19</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>My family usually gets together on weekends to talk, cook, eat and relax. I noticed that, sometimes, leftovers from cooked dishes get thrown away, which is a lot of waste for our environment and for our valets. I've been trying to change this by packing leftovers for everyone to take home. As long as these are stored safely and eaten within a couple of days, everyone wins!</pod-quote>
