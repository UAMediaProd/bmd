							<p>Feelings of stress, anxiety or depression cannot be seen by others. It can be difficult to tell how someone is feeling just by looking at them (or by looking at how they portray themselves on their social media feeds). Many people keep such feelings to themselves and struggle alone. They may be unaware that others feel similarly, or they feel like they should be able to cope. But lots can be done to make things better.</p>

							<p>Some of the people around you may <em>seem</em> to be fine but may actually be feeling very anxious (or depressed). <glossary placement="bottom" content="A mark of shame or disapproval that sets a person apart from others. These labels are assigned to the person or group against their will, and can perpetuate negative attitudes and discrimination.">Stigma</glossary> in society, or the way they have been raised, may affect how comfortable some people feel discussing their emotions. Are <em>you</em> comfortable expressing how you really feel?</p>
							<p>We can all help each other by being open to talking about such things. We can talk about our own feelings if it feels right to do so. We can recognise that others may not be ready to talk yet, so leaving the issue open may be all that is needed at that time.</p>

										<p>Gently raising the topic of wellbeing may be all you need to do.  You could say "You don't seem quite yourself. Are you OK?" or "I'm happy to talk if you want to". You could suggest a helpline (find a good selection <a href="https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/national-help-lines-and-websites" target="_blank">here</a>) if they would feel more comfortable talking to someone they don't know. Check if your university has a counselling service, including after-hours counselling.</p>
										<p>However, it is also important to respect people's boundaries. If they don't want to talk, don't try to force them. Just knowing you are there to support them is helpful.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>My housemate was being snappy with everyone and avoiding nights out to stay in alone. He's a really social person so this was unusual, and I was a bit worried to be honest. I knocked on his door and stuck my head round to ask if he was doing OK. He was just lying there, so I went in but went easy on him, saying I'd noticed a change, and did he want to talk. I told him that I didn't want to interfere, but I didn't want him to feel alone with whatever was worrying him.</p>
									<p>He actually started to talk then, and slowly he explained about how worried he was about money, and that he might not be able to stay at uni. We talked for a while, and came up with a plan of where to ask for advice &ndash; I'm glad I checked in on him as it was clearly eating him up and it felt good to be able to help.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I was worried about a friend from my course &ndash; she looked exhausted and often seemed close to tears in the lab. I asked her quietly if everything was OK, and she told me that her mum had been ill recently and she was finding it hard to cope. I suggested that she talk to the counselling service about getting some emotional support and to her topic coordinators about some extensions on her deadlines to make it easier for her to manage everything.</p></pod-quote>
