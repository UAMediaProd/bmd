							<p>Lots of distractions will compete for your time as a student. Maintaining a programme of physical activity for a prolonged period of time is not without its difficulties. Therefore, it is important for you to set your physical activity goals and be able to deal with setbacks along the way to achieving them.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Click through each step to read about the journey of achieving physical activity goals. A case study is included to provide some focus.</p></instructional-text>

									<h4>The five-step cycle</h4>
									<p>The five-step cycle is a continuous series of steps that join together to make up your pathway to success. It can be used in all areas of your life, including staying physically active.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Goals</h4>
									<p>The first step is to set your own goals. This can include goals that are related to achievement, such as keeping to physical activity schedules, or just feeling happier with your level of fitness.</p>
									<p><strong>Case study:</strong> Jesse is a Master's student who is keen to be more physically active and build their stamina.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Problem</h4>
									<p>The next step is problem recognition. This means identifying problems that make your goal more difficult to achieve. These may include a lack of motivation to be active, accessibility issues or a lack of support from others.</p>
									<p><strong>Case study:</strong> As a LGBT+ student, Jesse finds traditional gym environments intimidating. LGBT+ people may be less likely to participate in organised sports due to discrimination and difficulty accessing gender-appropriate exercise spaces.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Analysis</h4>
									<p>The next step is analysing the root of the problem. This could be poor sleep patterns, time management, or not asking for help when needed. It may also be something out of your control, like being excluded by others.</p>
									<p><strong>Case study:</strong> Because Jesse feels unwelcome at the local gym, but also doesn't feel comfortable exercising in public (like running in the park), they are confused about what to do next.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Design</h4>
									<p>The next step is to come up with a plan of action to resolve the problem. This involves using skills that you may have learned to overcome a similar problem in the past. Breaking down a goal into smaller chunks can also be very helpful.</p>
									<p><strong>Case study:</strong> Jesse has noticed some posters around campus advertising exercise classes that are inclusive and welcoming for LGBT+ students, and decides to enquire with student services about what options are available.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Doing</h4>
									<p>The final step is putting the plan into action to achieve your physical activity goals, and moving forward. The five-step cycle is part of many future cycles that join together to continue to improve your life.</p>
									<p><strong>Case study:</strong> Jesse has changed their physical activity expectations, and found options that they find enjoyable and welcoming. This will allow them to reach their goal of improving their level of physical activity and stamina.</p>

							<p>The five-step cycle is an effective tool to set physical activity goals and track your progress. It is also a good opportunity to think about any barriers that may be preventing you from exercising to the level you aim to reach, and how these can be overcome.</p>
