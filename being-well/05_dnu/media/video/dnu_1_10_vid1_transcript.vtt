I would say my diet is quite healthy. Although, I do allow myself to have treats every now and then or at special occasions. I eat, pretty much, everything. I'm not a fussy eater at all. So I like to stick to lots of protein and veggies, but I also love chocolate. So, pretty much, every day, I might have a bit of chocolate, which might not be the best for me, but it gets me through the day.

Apart from that, I eat all dairy. I don't have any allergies or anything. So I'm, very much, open to trying new foods. But I have a few staples that I know how to cook. So pasta, chicken, steak. that I like to keep to, just because I know how to cook them well, and they're cheap and easy.

I am pescaterian, which means I don't eat any meat, except for fish and seafood. And wherever possible, I try and avoid eating fish, dairy, and eggs, as well. I'm mainly pescaterian for environmental reasons and animal rights reasons.

My diet when I'm home mainly consists of foods that are not highly processed. So I try and cook a lot of vegetables, but I'm also terrible at cooking. So I eat a lot of pasta, soups, pretty basic curries, bean mixes. That sort of thing. When I'm not at home, I tend to eat a lot of takeaway and just, food that's really cheap to get on the go.
