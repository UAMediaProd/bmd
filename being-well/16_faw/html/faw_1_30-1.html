							<p>Before applying for any type of loan, make sure you have all the necessary information to hand. Depending on the type of loan, this will include your full name, date of birth (DOB), address, and any current employment and financial commitments, such as other loans or mortgages. Take the time to carefully read each question and answer it fully.</p>
							<p>The company you are applying to will be able to check some of the information you supply by undertaking a <glossary content="Lenders use your credit score to decide whether to give you credit or lend you money.">credit score</glossary> or credit rating check, which will form an important part of their decision-making. A credit search is a check made by a lender using a credit reference agency to view an applicant's credit history. See the screen titled: <em>Credit ratings (or credit score)</em> for more details.</p>

								<feedback-reveal>This is a difficult question, as there are lots of aspects to consider. Our natural inclination is likely to be to help a friend or family member in need, but lending money to someone you know can cause problems if the terms are not properly agreed. There is likely to be bad feeling if the money is not repaid in full, or in the time promised, which could damage the relationship. Think carefully before lending any money, and ensure there is a written agreement that states the expectations of both parties. Equally, if you are planning to borrow money from someone, think carefully about if you will be able to repay on time, and in full, and be honest about your situation.</feedback-reveal>
