							<p>Do you ever put things off or avoid doing them because of fear of failure, or not being good
								enough? Or maybe you have difficulty knowing when tasks are done, or spend lots of time
								going over something to get it 'just right'? Are you critical of yourself or others
								when you make mistakes, and have difficulty forgetting about the mistakes you have made? If
								so, you may be experiencing perfectionism.</p>
							<p>A lot of the time people think they know what perfectionism is, but it is actually not well understood and is often confused with other characteristics. One of the biggest barriers to recognising perfectionism is how society normalises some of the associated behaviours, making them harder to identify as problematic. </p>

												<mcq-answer>Myth</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>Not everyone who is perfectionistic will experience mental health difficulties. However, chasing unrealistic standards is more likely to create a stressful and demoralising sense of failure, which raises the risk of mental health difficulties. Some studies have found evidence that perfectionism is related to depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and bulimia (Limburg, K., <em>et al.</em>, 2017). </mcq-feedback>

												<mcq-feedback>Lots of research has examined perfectionism in students, so we know a lot about what it leads to and why. In one study of perfectionism, students were asked to identify what areas of their life they were perfectionistic about. Only 4% of students said there was no area of their life in which they were perfectionistic! (Stoeber, J., <em>et al.</em>, 2009).</mcq-feedback>

							<p>Because perfectionism is a risk factor for mental health difficulties, it is important to
								keep perfectionistic behaviour 'in check'. Everybody gets anxious and worried from
								time to time. However, if these feelings become overwhelming or uncontrollable, you should
								consider seeking help and support. Similarly, if being perfectionistic stops you from doing
								everyday jobs and generally enjoying your life, you should also seek help and support. </p>
