							<p>One of the biggest differences between HELP loans and commercial loans (like  <glossary content="A payment where a bank lends you a set amount of money, with a requirement that you make fixed monthly repayments.">personal loans</glossary> or <glossary placement="bottom" content="Also called a small amount loan. You can apply online or in-store, and borrow up to &dollar;2000. Depending on the terms, repayments need to be made anywhere between 16 days and one year after taking out the loan.  Lenders can't charge interest, but do charge high fees, usually a 20% establishment and 4% service fee per month.">payday loans</glossary>), is that how much you pay back each month is worked out based on how much you <em>earn</em>, rather than how much you <em>owe</em>. Australian students are expected to repay a percentage of any income over the repayment threshold. The more you earn, the higher your repayment will be. Indexation is added to your debt on 1 June each year (see <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for details).</p>
							<p>If you are not eligible for a HELP loan and are using commercial loans to pay your tuition fees, each repayment will be a set amount, usually each week or fortnight, based on the amount borrowed, term of the loan and interest rate.</p>
							<p>Check the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for further information on making your loan repayments.</p>

							<instructional-text-accessible><p>You will need a calculator for this activity. Have a go at working out what these graduates' monthly repayments will be, based on an example income threshold of &pound;25,725 a year. This is the repayment threshold for 2019/20. Work through the calculations and find the correct amount for each equation. We've filled in the first one for you as an example. Note that some of the answers will be negative numbers, and in these cases no repayment will be made as the threshold has not yet been met.</p></instructional-text-accessible>

							<p>We've given you these examples to look at to show you how much you might be repaying based on different salaries, but it's also important to remember that you won't need to do any of the maths! Your employer will deduct any repayments directly from your salary and pass it on to the Australian Tax Office (ATO) for you. Also, if your income changes each month, they'll recalculate it each pay day, and if your income drops below the threshold, for any reason at all, you'll simply stop making repayments until you are earning enough again. Some people may never earn enough to pay any of their loan back and that's absolutely fine, it's exactly how the system is meant to work!</p>
