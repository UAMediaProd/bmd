							<p>What is a healthy, balanced diet and how could this support student life? Let's start with the basics:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>A well-balanced diet consists of five food groups (proteins, dairy or alternatives, grain (cereal) food, fruit, and vegetables and legumes/beans)</li>
									<li>As far as possible, try to include these in your daily eating plan</li>
									<li>It's a good idea to eat a wide variety of different plants, like fruit, vegetables, <glossary content="Cereals or foods that contain the entire grain seed. These are associated with better health outcomes in comparison to more refined grains and cereals.">wholegrains</glossary>, <glossary content="Plants (such as peas, beans and lentils) that are a great source of proteins, carbohydrates and fibres. ">legumes</glossary> and nuts.</li>
									<li>If you have specific dietary requirements, it's a good idea to discuss these with an accredited dietitian or GP.</li>
								</ul>
							</text-block>

							<instructional-text><p>Recap your knowledge of the core food groups by clicking the boxes you wish to connect. Suggestions of portion sizes for each group and how many of these to eat each day will appear once you have correctly matched the groups with examples.</p></instructional-text>

								<matching-set>
									<match-left>Vegetables and legumes/beans</match-left>
									<match-right>Tomatoes, broccoli, carrots, chickpeas, cucumbers, peas</match-right>
									<match-feedback>
										<p>Vegetables and legumes are high in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are vital for supporting our bodily processes. These are also high in fibre, which is great for our gut health. The nutritional benefits of frozen and canned vegetables and legumes are as high as for fresh products. These are also often cheaper and easier to store than fresh foods, so stock up to save time and money! You should aim to eat at least five serves of vegetables and legumes every day. One serve is approximately 75g or any of the following:</p>
										<text-block>
											<ul>
												<li>&frac12; cup of cooked vegetables such as sweet potato, broccoli or green beans</li>
												<li>&frac12; cup of cooked legumes/beans such as chickpeas, lentils or peas</li>
												<li>1 medium tomato, cucumber or capsicum</li>
												<li>1 cup of green leafy or salad vegetables such as rocket or spinach.</li>

									<match-left>Grain (cereal) food</match-left>
									<match-right>Bread, noodles, oats, rice, breakfast cereals</match-right>
									<match-feedback>
										<p>These are a main source of energy production.  It's a good idea to include grains or cereals in every meal. Aim for the wholegrain variety that is high in fibre and low in added fat, sugar and salt. Most adults need about 4-6 serves of grain or cereal food per day. One serve of grain or cereal food is:</p>
										<text-block>
											<ul>
												<li>One slice of bread or 1 small roll or flat bread (35-40g)</li>
												<li>&frac12; cup of cooked rice, barley, pasta or noodles</li>
												<li>30g of muesli or cereal.</li>
											</ul>

								<matching-set>
									<match-left>Lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs or vegetarian alternatives such as tofu</match-left>
									<match-right>Chicken, eggs, meat, fish, beans</match-right>
									<match-feedback>
										<p>Dietary proteins from lean meats, fish, beans or lentils are required for the function of every cell in our body. If you eat fish, aim to eat a portion twice a week. Eat a variety of lean meats (if applicable), legumes, beans and peas a few times per week, and try to avoid too much processed meat and poultry as these might be high in fat and salt. About 2-3 serves of lean meats or alternatives should cover the daily requirements for most people. A serve of this food group is any of the following:</p>
										<text-block>
											<ul>
												<li>100g cooked fish or 65-80g of cooked meat (the size of your palm)</li>
												<li>2 cooked eggs (about 60g each)</li>
												<li>170g tofu</li>
												<li>1 handful of nuts (30g)</li>
												<li>1 cup of lentils or beans.</li>

								<matching-set>
									<match-left>Dairy and alternatives</match-left>
									<match-right>Cheese, milk or soy milk, nut milk, or yoghurt</match-right>
									<match-feedback>
										<p>Dairy is a great source of protein, calcium and other minerals and vitamins. If using dairy alternatives, such as nut milk, consider fortified options (e.g. with added vitamins and minerals, like calcium and zinc) and/or low-sugar options. Try and have three portions of these foods every day. One portion of dairy is any of the following:</p>
										<text-block>
											<ul>
												<li>250ml of milk, soy milk or nut milk</li>
												<li>200g of yoghurt</li>
												<li>40g of cheese or 120g of ricotta cheese.</li>

								<matching-set>
									<match-left>Oils and spreads</match-left>
									<match-right>Olive and canola oil, butter, margarine</match-right>
									<match-feedback>
										<p>Although oils and butters are not considered a food group, they are a great source of dietary fats, which are also required for energy production. Unsaturated oils of plant origin are the best (such as extra virgin olive oil). Try to avoid using too much fat of animal origin (such as butter) and plant-based oils with saturated fats (such as coconut and palm oils).</p>

								<matching-set>
									<match-left>Fruit</match-left>
									<match-right>Apple, orange, kiwi, banana</match-right>
									<match-feedback>
										<p>Just like vegetables, fruit is high in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are vital for good physical and mental health. Fruit is also a tasty and convenient snack and comes in its own nature-made packaging, which makes it easy to take to university with you for a quick study snack! Current recommendations suggest that you eat about two serves of fruit each day. One serve is about 150g or one of the following:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>1 medium piece of fruit, such as an apple, pear, banana or orange</li>
											<li>2 small pieces of fruit, such as plums or apricots</li>

							<p>You might have noticed that none of the examples we used to describe food groups included highly processed foods like chips, cakes, sweets or sugary soft drinks. This is because foods like these are usually quite low in nutritional value. These are absolutely fine to eat every now and then as part of an overall balanced diet; however, try not to have these too often.</p>
							<p>Base the majority of your food intake on plants like vegetables, fruit, legumes, grains and nuts, and enjoy!</p>

									<pod-quote>When I started living on my own, I learned how to cook a few simple dishes, like soups and stews &ndash; these include foods from all food groups, are easy to put together, and freeze well.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Simon, 21</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>There is a lot of information about what to eat and what not to eat out there. I thought I was doing OK. I ate a lot of protein foods, like lean meat and fish, and avoided fruit as I was worried about the sugar content. But now I understand that our bodies need foods from all food groups to function well. These include fruit, vegetables, grains, cereals, meat and dairy foods. I am doing my best to eat as much variety as I can.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Kristina, 46</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>In my shared house, we have a cooking rota and everyone takes turns to cook dinners once per week. We all prefer different foods, and two of us are vegetarian, so it was interesting learning about good alternatives to meat to use in my favourite spaghetti dish, like Quorn and tofu.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Azmir, 34</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>My family eats a lot of dishes made with mat beans, but I couldn't find any of these in my local shops. It took me a while to adjust some recipes by using other types of beans. Actually, it was my friend who showed me how.</pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Fatima, 19.</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote>I guess I am a lucky one as I still live at home and can rely on my parents when I need to. However, having classes and study sessions at variable times of the day makes it tricky to have meals together. I like to set time aside to cook with my dad on most weekends. This way he can teach me his cooking skills and I can pass on all the stuff I learn about nutrition at uni!</pod-quote>
