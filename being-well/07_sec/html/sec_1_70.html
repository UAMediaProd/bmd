							<p>There will be times where you find yourself supporting someone else who is lacking
								confidence, whose self-esteem is low and who doesn't believe they can be resilient. This
								section will help you think about how you can help them. It will also help you think about
								your own self-talk and the difference between how compassionate you are to others compared
								to how hard you are on yourself.</p>

								<!--ACTION MAZE 1-->
								<action-panel panel="1">
									<action-question>Your housemate, Lucy, is crying and says that she's worried that no one in her unit likes her. How would you respond?</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="2">"Lucy, don't worry about it. Who cares what people think?
										Just ignore them. Just don't listen to what those idiots are saying."
									</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="3">"Lucy, thanks for telling me. I know it isn't easy to talk about difficult feelings. Why don't you tell me a little bit more about what's been going on?"</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="4">"Lucy, I know what you are going through. Back at school I felt like no one liked me and it really upset me and made me feel depressed. Let me tell you what helped me when I was feeling like you are."
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="2" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Minimising the issue</h4>
									<p>Lucy is clearly upset but this response dismisses her feelings by minimising the
										issue. You might respond like this because you want to give Lucy some rational
										advice &ndash; "Just ignore them" &ndash; but ignoring negative comments or not
										caring what others think is very hard in reality. This advice will likely make Lucy
										feel worse.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="3" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Active listening</h4>
									<p>Properly listening to someone involves acknowledging them and reflecting back what
										they have said to check you have understood correctly. Asking what, or perhaps who,
										has helped before is a great question to ask as almost always people have found
										their own solutions to challenging situations before.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="4" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>How someone else feels is different to how you felt</h4>
									<p>It can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking how you felt and acted in a similar situation is the same as how your friend currently feels. By instantly explaining how things were for you, your attention is off how Lucy feels now and she will recognise that. Letting others know what they are experiencing is not unusual is fine, but spend time understanding what Lucy is feeling.</p>
								</action-panel>

								<!--ACTION MAZE 2-->
								<action-panel panel="5">
									<action-question>Your course mate, Priscilla, has just told you she has failed her first
										university assignment. She is distraught and believes this is proof she is not
										intelligent enough to complete a degree. How would you respond?</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="6">"Oh Priscilla, that's tough. Did you do all the required reading? Did you research enough? Maybe you'll do better next time if you work harder."</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="7">"Priscilla, don't be silly. Everyone has a bump in the road
										at some point at uni. Best to get it out of the way early. I know how you are
										feeling. I only got a pass in my first assignment and I was distraught, but I kept on
										going and I'm doing pretty well now."</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="8">"I can see that is a real blow for you, Priscilla. You
										cannot base your ability on one assignment though. What was the feedback like? Are
										there things in there you recognise you could improve on? If so then see this as a
										learning opportunity. Your first assignment is probably only formative anyway."
									</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="6" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Blaming</h4>
									<p>Accepting Priscilla's statement that she has failed will only strengthen her negative
										self-talk. It can be useful to find out whether the steps Priscilla had taken in
										attempting her assignment were sufficient, but the way this is phrased sounds
										accusatory. This response will likely make Priscilla feel worse.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="7" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>A similar experience is not the same experience</h4>
									<p>Normalising that all students have a bump in the road in their degree is often
										helpful as people tend to think they are the only ones to struggle. Knowing others
										experience similar situations helps people to feel that their response is normal.
										What is not helpful here is assuming that your experience is the same as Priscilla's, when you actually received different grades.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="8" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Learning opportunity</h4>
									<p>Acknowledging how Priscilla is feeling is a good start here, as it helps Priscilla to know that she has been heard. The response quickly helps Priscilla shift from her all-or-nothing fixed-mindset thinking to seeing how this is an excellent opportunity to learn and improve. Almost certainly, there will be positive comments in the feedback, as well as constructive criticism she can learn from. This response isn't about you but is all about Priscilla's next steps.</p>
								</action-panel>

								<!--ACTION MAZE 3-->
								<action-panel panel="9">
									<action-question>Your friend, Mohammed, is really upset and angry because his girlfriend
										has just dumped him. He tells you that he loved her and that he will never find
										anyone else. How would you respond?</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="10">"Mohammed, I don't know what to say. To be honest, she was always messing you about &ndash; you're better off without her. There's plenty more fish in the sea. You'll find someone who isn't so manipulative and demanding next time."</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="11">"Mohammed, you're a great bloke and she's stupid to leave
										you. Look at everything you have going for you. Good looks, great sense of humour,
										intelligent, athletic. You're at a great university. Where else is she going to find
										someone like you?" </action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="12">"I'm so sorry Mohammed, this must be tough for you. It will take time, but you will start to feel better. You've been through challenges before, haven't you? We'll be here to support you through this, whether by distracting you with activities, or just stopping by for a chat."</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="10" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Someone else's fault </h4>
									<p>It can be very tempting to absolve your friend from any responsibility and blame
										other people. Blaming others is easy to do but any relationship involves two people
										who are jointly responsible for making it work. The implicit criticism of Mohammed in
										this response is that he fell in love with a 'manipulative' person and he shouldn't
										have. Mohammed's negative self-talk is likely to pick up on this and increase his
										self-blame.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="11" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Praise is not always helpful</h4>
									<p>Your response here is to praise Mohammed's strengths and indeed that can be very
										helpful, but it can also be counterproductive. If Mohammed is such a great catch, as
										you have just told him, he may feel self-blame that he still couldn't keep the
										person he loves. This response does not leave Mohammed any room to learn and grow as
										it is not helping him to reflect on what has been happening in the relationship.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="12" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Compassionate acknowledgement of the pain</h4>
									<p>It is so tempting to offer advice and you so want to find the right phrase to remove
										the pain from your friend, but no one can. This response is all about acknowledging
										that it is a painful process and one that will take a while for Mohammed to emerge
										from. You offer some specific actions you can do together to help him; reiterate he
										has a good support network and encourage him to think of previous difficult times he
										has overcome.</p>
								</action-panel>

								<!--ACTION MAZE 4-->
								<action-panel panel="13">
									<action-question>Your colleague, Erica, is shaking as she tells you she witnessed her housemate self-harming last night. She helped with cleaning up the injuries while another housemate took the girl to A&E. How would you respond?</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="14">"That's so horrible Erica. Poor you. Who was self-harming?
										Do I know her? Honestly, I think it's selfish of her to put you all in that
										position. She shouldn't really be at university if she can't look after herself
										properly." </action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="15">"Wow. Is she OK now? Did you not go with her to the
										hospital? Did you not spot that your housemate was so unhappy she wanted to hurt
										herself? You know, one of the guys in my flat was talking about hurting himself but
										I talked him out of it." </action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="16">"That must have been such a shock. Are you all right, Erica?
										Do you want to talk about it? Your housemate's safety is not your responsibility, but
										I'm sure it felt that way last night. I'm happy to talk to you about it, but you might also want to think about talking to a counsellor at the university. They'll
										be able to help as they are experts in this kind of thing." </action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="14" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Focus on the third party</h4>
									<p>This response is one designed to learn about gossip. You have not enquired as to how
										Erica is feeling or if she needs any support, and it also shows a lack of empathy
										about a serious situation. Erica is likely to feel dismissed and alone by this
										response.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="15" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Could you have done more?</h4>
									<p>It is normal in a traumatic situation to think back to whether you could have done
										more to help or prevent the situation. Negative self-talk is very good at creating
										self-reproach and you insinuating Erica has not done enough will only feed her
										critical inner voice. Putting your own (positive) experience into the conversation
										will only make Erica feel worse, although you may feel momentarily superior.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="16" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Realistic</h4>
									<p>Empathising with how Erica is feeling is always a good place to start. Reflecting
										back what you have heard both allows Erica to know she has been properly understood
										and gives you thinking time in how to respond to this unusual situation. You have
										also sensibly recognised the limits of the help you can offer in this area by
										signposting Erica to some of the support available at the university, while also
										offering a listening ear yourself.</p>

							<p>You probably found some of the responses outrageous, but just take a moment to think how often your self-talk tells you those same outrageous things. As we have discussed throughout this module, thinking about what you would say to a friend is a great way to check if you are being compassionate enough with your self-talk.</p>

									<p>Active listening involves giving your total attention to the other person, so make sure you are away from distractions.</p>
									<p>Avoid jumping to problem solving or sharing your own experience and concentrate on really understanding how the other person feels. Reflect back what you have heard using their own words as much as possible &ndash; for example, "OK, what I think you are telling me is that you don't feel good enough to stay on that society committee. Is that right?". This both gives the speaker a chance to hear what they have been thinking out loud and allows them the opportunity to correct you. Use open questions, such as "Can you tell me more about why you think that?". Open questions engage the speaker more.</p>
									<p>Remember that people communicate by more than words alone. A person may say, "I feel great" but their body language and tone are telling you something else. Ensure you pick up on that discrepancy by saying, "I hear that you are saying you feel great, but the way you are saying it makes me think you are not feeling that great. Can you tell me what's really going on for you?".</p>
									<p>You should use closed questions to check your understanding and towards the end of any conversation when the speaker has come up with some actions, for example: "You've agreed to give the next committee meeting a go and I've agreed we will meet for coffee beforehand and I will help you manage your worries about it. Does that sound like something you can do?".</p>
									<p>For more information on using open and closed conversations, see the module titled: <em>Your student journey.</em></p>
