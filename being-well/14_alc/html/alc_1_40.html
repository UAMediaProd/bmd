							<p>While it is easy for people to share good times and happy news with others, it can be more of a challenge to share sorrow or worries. As hard as it may be, doing so is actually a very healthy habit.  Let's try to understand ourselves a bit better and think about how we use alcohol to deal with emotions or difficult moments in life. Even if you don't drink alcohol at all, this section can be very useful if you are concerned about a friend, or are trying to support someone else. Some tips should be applicable to any aspect of your life!</p>

										<p>If you are worried about a friend's drinking habits, try to have an honest conversation with them. You want to help them, but you are not in a position to provide medical help. It is a difficult conversation, so follow this advice to help your friend open up and find solutions to change:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Never corner someone and embarrass them about their drinking habits. Raising the issue in a respectful and non-judgemental way will usually have a positive result</li>
											<li>Ask them open, indirect questions about their drinking habits. For example: "What do you enjoy the most about going out?" This will help to bring the topic around to drinking in a natural way</li>
											<li>If you can't think of open questions to continue the conversation, simply reflect on what your friend is telling you. For instance, if your friend says: "I really embarrassed myself last night when I was drinking", you might reply, "I'm sorry you feel embarrassed by what happened". This shows that you are listening actively and taking in what they are saying</li>
											<li>Highlight anything positive about your friend's behaviour in relation to drinking alcohol. For example, if your friend proudly tells you that they did not drink last week, say something like: "That's really good, you are on the right track".</li>
										</ul>
										<p>These tips are based on a motivation interviewing approach. If you want to learn more, <a href="http://www.motivationalinterview.net/clinical/whatismi.html" target="_blank">check this link</a>.</p>

									<p>If you are worried about your drinking, or the way a friend uses alcohol, you can contact the university's support and wellbeing services directly. They will be able to offer advice and support to help build a healthier relationship with alcohol. You could also contact your GP for advice on cutting down on the amount you are drinking.</p>

							<p>If you want to continue with a good habit or change something that you don't like about your
								drinking, we suggest these tips to nudge your own behaviour:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>Have something to eat before, or while, you are drinking. Alcohol is absorbed into the body much faster on an empty stomach</li>
									<li>Find temporal boundaries. For instance, drink only during the weekends</li>
									<li>Establish physical boundaries. For example, don't drink in your bedroom</li>
									<li>Write things down and/or keep a diary to have somewhere to express your emotions</li>
									<li>Store drinks and alcohol-related items out of daily sight</li>
									<li>Plan a budget in advance for drinking and/or going out</li>
									<li>Have a glass of water for every alcoholic drink.</li>
								</ul>

							<p>You can apply most of these behavioural tips to anything in your life that you feel might be
								becoming an unhealthy or compulsive habit.</p>
							<p>Try to keep track of how you are feeling, and if you feel comfortable with the amount you are drinking. If drinking behaviours are consistent with your own expectations, you will feel more comfortable about your interactions while drinking. Check the <em>'Students say'</em> pod for videos with students talking about their drinking habits, and how they moderate their behaviour.</p>
