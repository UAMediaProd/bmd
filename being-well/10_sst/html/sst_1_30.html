							<p>The build-up to suicidal feelings might seem similar to that of self-harm in that there are different levels of intensity, but there is an important difference between the two. While moving to self-harm is more like a sequential build-up, individuals at risk of suicide may experience different thoughts at different times, but one doesn't necessarily lead to the next stage.</p>
							<p>For example, some people may experience what they would consider more fleeting thoughts about suicide, but never go on to think about actually ending their lives. Whereas, some people can live for years with strong thoughts of suicide, without ever acting on them.</p>
							<p>For some, there are no warning signs at all and suicidal thoughts can come 'out of the blue', often in response to a crisis. Thinking about support strategies to use at times of difficulty can help.</p>

The bottom level is 'Not at immediate risk: Suicidal ideas'. For this risk level, you might respond with 'It sounds really difficult for you. Do you ever have thoughts of harming yourself, or ending your life in response to how you feel?' Someone at this level might describe their feelings as 'Sometimes I just want to get out of everyone's way; I feel I am a burden'. The second level is 'Some risk: Thoughts with some intention'. At this risk level, you might respond with 'I need to ask whether you are intending to end your life.' Someone at this level may express 'Sometimes I think about that. I have collected some of my medication.' The top level is 'High risk: Specific intention to act.' At this risk level, your response should be to seek help immediately. Someone at this level may express that they intend to kill themselves."/>

							<!-- ACTIVITY START -->
							<process>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Fleeting suicidal thoughts</h4>
									<p>Occasional thoughts of suicide, or general thoughts of death, which tend not to last for a long period of time and rarely focus on the person's own death.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>More intense suicidal thoughts (sometimes called 'ideation')</h4>
									<p>Here, thoughts are more persistent than fleeting, and are a little more focused. They can often be about suicide as a solution to problems and thoughts of not being around anymore, but do not focus on how suicide might take place.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Suicidal thoughts with some plans</h4>
									<p>Although this is still mainly thinking, rather than planning, the thoughts have more focus and can increasingly relate to how suicidal thoughts might be acted on.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Suicidal planning but without intending to act on them</h4>
									<p>At this stage there will be more focused thoughts about the 'how' of suicide, with greater thinking invested into the different ways of ending one's life, but without any intention to act on these plans.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>An intention to act on suicidal thoughts</h4>
									<p>This is the highest risk stage, where the person has thought about what they would do to end their life and has an intention to act on it &ndash; either immediately, or at a planned time in the future.</p>

							<p>As we can see, the types of thoughts about suicide will relate more to the intensity of the feeling and, therefore, the level of risk someone might be at. Essentially, any thoughts of suicide, no matter how fleeting they might be, should be taken seriously. It is important to note that most people interviewed after a suicide attempt express relief that their attempt was not successful. It is always important to find someone to talk to about your feelings, or use your university's health or counselling services, who will be able to help you find the right sort of support.</p>

								<p>If you are worried about a friend, it is always better to be honest with them about it. Saying to someone, "I've been worried about you because you haven't seemed yourself recently &ndash; do you want to talk?" will often be experienced as extremely caring, even if they don't feel able to talk at that point.</p>
								<p>Knowing that someone you care for is struggling can be a huge source of anxiety and concern, and can leave us feeling guilty that we can't easily help them feel better. Don't put pressure on yourself to 'fix' their problems; being a good listener is equally important.</p>
								<p>Many of the self-harm and suicide helplines listed on the <em>Resource bank</em> screen also offer guidance as to how to support someone else who is struggling.</p>
