							<p>Humans are designed to do their best thinking whilst being physically active, and building exercise into your routine is vital to support successful study at university. However, some students may find it difficult to overcome barriers to a physically active lifestyle.</p>

											<p>David, a mature Psychology student, has a busy schedule with lots of studying and family commitments. He is aware that physical activity reduces stress and will give him the energy he needs to succeed in his studies.</p>

									<p>With careful planning, David can achieve a balance between his family commitments and time dedicated to physical activity and academic work. As a mature student with an active home life, he may want to try:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Carrying gym clothes so he can exercise during lunch breaks/in-between lectures</li>
										<li>'Deskercise' at home or at university (e.g. doing leg exercises, gently stretching in his chair, using small weights whilst reading)</li>
										<li>Connecting with a fitness-minded fellow student to play a sport</li>
										<li>Going on bike rides with his family</li>
										<li>Joining a 24-hour gym.</li>

										<note-question>
											<p>Rachel is a first-year Law student. She thinks of herself as too large to exercise in traditional gyms or in public view due to the judgement she feels from others. She is keen to take up any exercise opportunities for her physical and mental wellbeing.</p>

									<p>Rachel can take part in exercise that is inclusive and less intimidating for students who may be fearful of traditional physical activity settings, such as gyms or exercise classes. Rachel may want to try:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Walking with friends or exploring the local sights on foot &ndash; a great way to get to know a new area!</li>
										<li>Getting off the bus a few stops early to walk some of the way</li>

											<p>Marvin needs to work to supplement the income he receives from his Centrelink payments. Although he enjoys being fit and healthy, he feels he has to prioritise spending money on rent, travel expenses and food rather than leisure pursuits such as sport and exercise. </p>

									<p>Many universities provide subsidised gym membership. Depending on the facilities available at his university, Marvin may be able to enjoy access to a whole range of low-cost or free activities, such as yoga or relaxation sessions, rock-climbing facilities, the use of gym equipment or even a swimming pool. Marvin may want to try:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Talking to staff at the university's gym or student services about available options</li>
										<li>Looking at the clubs and societies listings to join a team &ndash; also a great way to make new friends</li>
										<li>Organising a five-a-side football or rounders tournament with friends</li>

										<note-question>
											<p>Anna read a report stating that people with disabilities are twice as likely to be physically inactive than people without a disability. This has made her think about her own level of physical activity, and she's keen to do more. However, she's unsure about her options in terms of accessibility.</p>

									<p>As a student, Anna is able to access a wide range of traditional and adapted forms of exercise to help her increase her recommended level of physical activity. Anna may want to try:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Getting in contact with student services at her university &ndash; they will be able to give her advice on the types of classes or opportunities her university offers</li>
										<li>Looking for organisations in her local area that support people with disabilities to stay active</li>
										<li>Asking the teacher privately if a class she is interested in is accessible &ndash; many teachers are willing to adapt a class if it's possible</li>
										<li>Incorporating physical activity into her socialising &ndash; for example, going ten-pin bowling or dancing with friends.</li>

							<p>Exercising with peers is an effective way of motivating each other to be active. It is also a great way to meet new friends. Taking time out to exercise with other students around exam times may not feel like a priority but it provides energy for better studying. Try to encourage a friend to go on a walk or run with you, especially if they find it hard to prioritise physical activity. Also try to be mindful about whether your peers have access to the same opportunities as you do, and, if you feel you would like to, get involved in any campaigns on campus to offer more diverse sporting activities and exercise options for all.</p>
