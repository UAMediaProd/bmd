							<p>A credit rating (sometimes referred to as a credit score) is used by banks and other financial institutions to determine whether finance can be offered. Your credit rating (or credit score) will be taken into account when you apply for a mobile phone contract, personal loan or credit card.</p>
							<p>Factors that will affect your credit score include:</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>The amount of money you have borrowed</li>
									<li>The number of credit applications you have made, e.g. for credit cards, mobile phone contracts</li>
									<li>Whether you pay on time.</li>
								</ul>

									<pod-quote><p>My housemates and I couldn't make our electricity bill payment. The bill was in my name and I was getting stressed that the power would be disconnected.  I spoke to an advisor on campus who helped me contact the electricity company to organise affordable instalments, so that we could catch up the payments and I didn't have a default on my credit report.</p></pod-quote>

								<p><strong>Anita (thinking):</strong>  I need to get out of my overdraft or the bank is just going to keep calling me, and I need to catch up on my rent repayments &ndash; I'm already a month behind. I don't know what to do, I can't concentrate on anything and my project is due by Friday...</p>

								<p><strong>Anita (thinking):</strong> I'm so glad I asked for advice, I feel like I'm finally getting on top of things and can spend more time focused on my work. It's such a relief not to feel worried all the time! I need to work on my credit score before I'll be accepted for a loan, but one step at a time...</p>

							<p>Hopefully you have gained an insight into how important your credit rating is, and how it can influence your ability to access credit in the future. </p>
							<p>One example of this is using a credit card. Ensure that you closely monitor your use of the card, and remember that they should be used as the exception, rather than the rule. Unfortunately, it is very easy to run up a large debt, which may ultimately cause financial hardship if you cannot make the monthly payments.</p>
							<p>It is possible to check your current credit rating &ndash; see the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for details.</p>
