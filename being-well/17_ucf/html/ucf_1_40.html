									<p>Talking about money can be difficult and everyone's situation is different, so it is important to be respectful when talking about money matters. However, if you feel comfortable discussing your finances, you may find that your friends have similar concerns, and you can offer each other support and assistance.</p>

							<p>Grants, bursaries, Centrelink, and scholarships are pots of money you can apply for and you never have to pay back, no matter how much you earn after university. But not everyone will be eligible for them, and some are specific to your university or situation, so it's worth doing some research to see what might apply to you.</p>

							<p>Check the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for information on government funding. For grants and bursaries, a good starting point is your university's website. This will have a finance section with all the information on what is available, and you could also book an appointment with student services to discuss opportunities. </p>
							<p>Grants and bursaries are designed to help students achieve their full potential, so do check what is available, and make a claim if you are eligible. </p>
