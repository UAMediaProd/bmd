										<p>Welcome to the module on self-harm and suicidal thoughts.</p>
										<p>If this is the first time you have accessed a module in the <em>Being Well,
												Living Well</em> programme, or if you need a brief reminder, here is some
											information on how the screens are organised, and some of the tools and features
											that are used throughout:</p>
										<hr>
										<h3>Content</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>The centre of each screen contains the core content for each course, presented either as text, interactive activities, graphics, videos or animations</li>
											<li><instructional-text>Text highlighted in a box preceded by an arrow contains instructions on how to navigate the activities that follow</instructional-text></li>
											<li>Terms <glossary content="highlighted like this">highlighted like this</glossary> are clickable glossary terms, and can be clicked on to access pop-up boxes containing definitions of key terms</li>
											<li>Note that your responses to the note-making and text entry activities (where you type responses in the space provided) can be printed and used as part of your ongoing work</li>
											<li class="hide-mobile hide-in-accessible-version">At the top of each screen you will see an indication of the approximate time it will take to complete the core content. These estimates include time to watch the videos and complete the activities in the central section, but not to complete the 'Optional activities'.</li>

										<hr>
