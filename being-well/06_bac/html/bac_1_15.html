											<p><strong>Moderate physical activity</strong> includes exercise that raises
												your heart rate, makes you breathe faster and makes you feel warmer. Which one of the
												following physical activities do you think fits into this category?</p>
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>Brisk walking or wheelchair use</mcq-answer>
											</mcq-option>

										</mcq-options>

											<p>Official guidelines recommend at least 2.5 hours of moderate physical activity per week (Australian Government Department of Health, 2019). However, any amount of this exercise is good for
												you. This includes a range of physical activities such as walking, cleaning the house, gardening, tai chi, lifting and carrying &ndash; with many of these activities run inside if the weather is not suitable.</p>

											<p><strong>Vigorous physical activity</strong> makes you breathe hard and fast.
												If you are working at this level, you won't be able to say more than a few
												words without pausing for breath. Which of the following options represents
												vigorous physical activity?</p>

										</mcq-options>
										<mcq-feedback>
											<p>Vigorous physical activity brings health benefits over and above that of
												moderate activity. In fact, half as much vigorous activity is needed to get
												similar benefits as from moderate exercise. Nonetheless, a combination of both types of activity is best so as not to place too much stress on the body. These activities should always be in response to the weather and with adequate hydration.</p>

											<p>Alongside moderate and vigorous physical activities,
												<strong>muscle-strengthening exercises</strong> help to maintain health and
												wellbeing. Strength-based exercises work all the major muscles (legs, hips,
												back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). From the following options,
												select the activity which directly builds strength:</p>

											<p>Muscle-strengthening exercises include a variety of activities that need to be performed safely and with adequate rest and recovery. These may include lifting weights, working with resistance bands, yoga, active gardening (such as digging and shovelling), hill walking and dancing.</p>
