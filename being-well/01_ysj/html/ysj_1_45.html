							<p>Feeling like you belong to a group is such a basic human need, it is natural to feel anxious about being accepted and 'fitting in'. But a true sense of belonging will only come from connections based on who you really are and what is important to you. The student journey offers wonderful opportunities to develop and grow your own unique identity.</p>

								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-a" variant="south" location="63,11"
									label="Family and community" heading="Family and community"
									content="The people you consider to be your family influence what you do, the way you think, the things you care about, and much more. Sometimes this can mean that we think and behave in ways that are similar to our family, and other times it can mean that we intentionally do things very differently. How have your family and community influenced your identity? How has this changed over time?"

								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-b" variant="south" location="272,2"
									label="Cultural identities" heading="Cultural identities"
									content="Cultural groups affecting your identity may include a geographic area, such as a country, region or community that you live in. Or belonging to the LGBT+ community, a particular race or ethnic community, a spiritual or faith group, or disability community such as the deaf community. Your cultural identity may also be shaped by an interest-orientated community such as music, art, gaming or athletics. Which cultural groups do you identify with?"

								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-c" variant="south" location="571,182"
									label="Social identities" heading="Social identities"
									content="Our social identities are the significant group categorisations assigned to us by the society we live in, and the attributes our society attaches to these categories. These include cultural identities such as our racial, ethnic, gender or religious identities, or those related to economic class, geographic area or sexuality. How do your social identities advantage or disadvantage you or influence your expectations of yourself or others?"
									placement="left"></labelled-graphic-hotspot>
								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-d" variant="south" location="518,253"
									label="Gender identity and expression" heading="Gender identity and expression"
									content="Your gender identity is your internal sense of being male, female, both or neither. It may differ from your biological sex. Your gender expression is how you present your gender to the world. Society often puts pressure on people to define and express their gender in a particular way (such as wearing specific clothing). This can limit how comfortable people feel expressing their gender. What aspects of your life affect how you express your gender?"
									placement="left"></labelled-graphic-hotspot>
								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-e" variant="south" location="535,110"
									label="Sexuality" heading="Sexuality"
									content="Sexuality encompasses sex, sexual orientation (who we are attracted to if we feel sexual attraction), eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. It is experienced and expressed in our thoughts, values, behaviours, fantasies, desires, beliefs and attitudes. Our sexuality is personal but how we express it can be influenced by our family, culture, social group or religion &ndash; in both positive and negative ways. How comfortable do you currently feel with your sexuality?"
									placement="left"></labelled-graphic-hotspot>
								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-f" variant="south" location="0,113"
									label="Values, faith or spirituality" heading="Values, faith or spirituality"
									content="Your values are judgements you make about what is important or meaningful to you. Our values come from our homes, families, communities, schools, peers, culture, people we respect and society in general. Values and meaning can also be derived from spirituality (a sense of being connected to something bigger than oneself), or the shared beliefs of religion. Values and beliefs can sometimes clash. What are your values and where do you find meaning?"
									placement="right"></labelled-graphic-hotspot>
								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-g" variant="south" location="436,170"
									label="Personality" heading="Personality"
									content="We all have things we find easy or natural and those which take more time, attention or effort. Some challenges may be linked to disabilities, including barriers created by the actions or prejudices of others, or limited expectations. But conditions causing limitations can also bring special strengths &ndash; such as the fresh perspectives that can come with neurodiversity (e.g. autism). How do your strengths and challenges affect how you see yourself?"
									placement="left"></labelled-graphic-hotspot>
								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-h" variant="south" location="19,271"
									label="Personal strengths and challenges" heading="Personal strengths and challenges"
									content="Your personality traits include preferring quiet and time alone or being more social. Your sense of humour, how animated and expressive you are, whether you prefer routine or spontaneity, are cautious or a risk-taker, and being optimistic or pessimistic, are other examples. Factors influencing your personality are there from birth, but it is also shaped through your experiences. How would you or others describe your personality?"
									placement="right"></labelled-graphic-hotspot>
								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-i" variant="south" location="60,203"
									label="Vocational identity" heading="Vocational identity"
									content="A key identity that you are shaping as a university student is your vocational or career identity, linked to the course you have chosen to study and your prospective employment prospects. This could be related to your subject discipline &ndash; becoming a historian or geographer &ndash; or to a specific job role, like being a doctor, lawyer or graphic designer. How closely do you identify with the future identity or prospects linked to your course?"
									placement="right"></labelled-graphic-hotspot>
								<labelled-graphic-hotspot class="point-j" variant="south" location="497,7"
									label="Learner/researcher identity" heading="Learner/researcher identity"
									content="Your view of yourself as a learner or researcher is shaped by your learning experiences, successes and challenges and is central to your student journey. A crucial aspect of this is your mindset &ndash; whether you adopt a fixed mindset about your abilities or a growth mindset, recognising that effort and perseverance are much more relevant to success than 'talent'. What is your current mindset?"

									<p>Becoming more aware of the many factors contributing to your own identity is also an
										opportunity to consider the complex identities of your peers. How can you
										contribute to an environment where everyone's values and identities are accommodated

										include peers who don't drink alcohol?</p>

							<p>Although some basic categories of our identity are fixed, their meaning and importance
								&ndash; for
								us and for others &ndash; are likely to change over time. Exploring who you are, deepening
								your
								understanding of what is important to you and developing your identity are central parts of
								the student journey. </p>
							<p>Keeping your personal values in mind offers you a valuable compass to guide your direction as
								you travel the journey. This compass is also an important guide for building meaningful
								connections and relationships with the people around you, which is such an important
								ingredient in your sense of belonging.</p>
