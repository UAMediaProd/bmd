							<p><strong>Negative Automatic Thoughts (NATs)</strong> are unfair critical pieces of self-talk that can influence your thinking without you being aware of them. We all have NATs and recognising the ones that impact you most will help you to limit their influence and start to learn how to challenge them.</p>

								<p>Active listening is the key to supporting your friends in recognising and challenging their Negative Automatic Thoughts (NATs).</p>
								<p>It is tempting to say, "Yeah me too" and talk about yourself, and it is very easy to move straight to problem-solving mode.</p>
								<p>It is much more helpful to reflect on what your friend has said so they feel understood. Try paraphrasing what they have said and conclude with a question, for example, "Have I understood that properly?". This allows them to actually hear their negative self-talk spoken out loud and gives them the opportunity to correct it.</p>

							<p>You may have recognised a few of these NATs in your own thoughts and behaviours. Training yourself to recognise NATs can be highly beneficial for your sense of self-confidence and wellbeing.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Consider each of the NATs and rate how often (if at all) you have these thoughts. Select the 'I always think like this' category, and choose the NATs that fit into this category for you. Then do the same for the other categories.</p></instructional-text>

							<p>Recognising Negative Automatic Thoughts does not happen overnight. It takes a great deal of work and some people will benefit from professional help. Once you have recognised your NATs, the process usually goes like this:</p>
							
							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li>You recognise that your NATs took hold after the event. Don't let a NAT make you think you cannot overcome your NATs (think about it!)</li>
									<li>You recognise your NATs taking hold during a situation. Sometimes you can challenge these in the moment and respond accordingly, but often you will not. Recognise that this is progress</li>
									<li>After a while, as you get better at noticing your NATs, you either challenge them or let them go, rather than acting on them</li>
									<li>As you get better at managing your NATs, you will stop being aware you are doing it. You will have a new way of thinking.</li>
								</ul>
