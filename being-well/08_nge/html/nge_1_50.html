										<p>You can learn to be less perfectionistic, but it takes conscious effort to do so &ndash; lots of self-reflection and challenging your perfectionistic ways of thinking. As we have seen in the accounts of other students, university can be stressful, but you can find ways of being successful and happy during your studies. If you would like help managing your perfectionistic tendencies, speak to your friends, family or support services at your university. </p>

									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>Perfectionism influences student life in different ways &ndash; generally it makes life more stressful and difficult. The exact way it influences your life will be unique to you and depend on in what ways you are perfectionistic. If you are perfectionistic towards your studies, it may be that you find it difficult completing assignments, or working with others, or that you are especially stressed out by the idea of presenting your work in front of your class mates.</p>

									<ladder-number>1</ladder-number>
									<ladder-feedback>
										<p>Perfectionism is a personality characteristic that exists in everyone. It shouldn't be confused with having high or even very high standards. Perfectionism is about having unrealistic standards. It is not a mental health disorder, but it is a risk factor for mental health difficulties.</p>
