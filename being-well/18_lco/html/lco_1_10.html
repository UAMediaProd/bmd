							<p>Whether you are moving away from home for the first time, staying at home and commuting, or returning to study as a mature student, starting a new course at university will require you to make many decisions. One of the most important things you will need to consider is where you will live while studying. Looking into all your options and planning ahead will help you make the best choices.</p>
							<p>Check the <em>'Students say'</em> pod for interviews with students talking about how they chose their accommodation.</p>

										<node-heading>University accommodation</node-heading>
										<node-content>Some universities have accommodation &ndash; usually called 'colleges' or 'halls' &ndash; either on campus or located nearby.  A range of university accommodation options may be available, depending on your university. You may be able to choose from a single bedroom with a shared bathroom and kitchen, en-suite rooms with shared kitchen or living facilities, studio flats, accessible rooms or family accommodation. Ask about how housing is allocated, and be sure to discuss any specific requirements you have. This type of accommodation can be more expensive than other options, but can be a good option if you are new to the area.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Managed student accommodation</node-heading>
										<node-content>Purpose-built student accommodation managed by private companies and not the university. These offer a range of room types, including studios and flats. Many include extras in the rent price, such as digital TV services or laundry services. Often in prime locations, these accommodations have security features and staffing comparable to university accommodation, but may not have the same connection to university welfare support.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Private rental</node-heading>
										<node-content>A shared house or single room in a private house that you agree to rent, usually from a private landlord. Students with families may need to rent a flat or house to accommodate their needs.  Often the lease will be for 12 months, rather than the university year, and bills are not usually included in the rent. You will need to pay two week's rent in advance, and a bond, which you will get back at the end of the contract. The bond is usually equal to four weeks' rent in advance, although this can differ in each state.</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Living at home </node-heading>
										<node-content>Many students already live within commuting distance of their university and don't need to leave home when they start their studies. You may also have family commitments, which means moving out is not practical. It is often cheaper to stay at home, but remember to include your travel costs in your overall budget. You should think about the length of your commute, and consider whether this will fit in with other commitments you have and enable you to participate in the social aspects of university life. Is your family happy to adapt to the changes that your studying will bring?</node-content>
									</concept-node>
									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>Lodging in someone's home, or a homestay</node-heading>
										<node-content>This could be a great option if you are happy to live in someone else's home. It can be cheaper than other options, but you must be prepared to respect your host's house rules. For international students in particular, living with a host family will allow you to learn a lot about the local area, culture, customs and language. It can feel like a 'home from home'.</node-content>

							<p>If you have never rented accommodation before, you will need to deal with a lot of new information and terminology. As a tenant, you have important rights. Understanding these rights will help to build your confidence about entering the rental market.</p>
