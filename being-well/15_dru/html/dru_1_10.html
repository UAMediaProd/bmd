							<p>It is quite likely that you will be exposed <glossary placement="bottom" content="Drugs that are consumed for leisure.">recreational drugs</glossary> during your time at university, as drug-taking is relatively common in Australian student culture. This module discusses the kinds of recreational drugs you might come across and the possible effects, as well as the legal implications. By the end of the module, you will be in a position to make informed choices about drug use and will have learnt some key harm reduction strategies.</p>

											Chelsea is turning 21 today and is going out to celebrate. She's excited as it's the first time that her friends from school and university are coming together. Some of them want to drop mandy (MDMA). She's never tried it. She feels curious about trying it, but isn't sure whether tonight is the best time to take it. She's already a bit overwhelmed with all the fuss around her birthday, and really wants her two groups of friends to get on with each other. She's not sure how her school friends will feel about it, and she's concerned about the possibility of her friend being caught handing out drugs on the night out.

													<p><strong>Incorrect.</strong></p>
													<p>Chelsea's friend is supplying drugs to others. Although she may not be making a profit or regularly dealing drugs, on this occasion what she has done is considered dealing or 'intent to supply', which is illegal. She has also put evidence of her intention to supply on an instant messaging service, which could easily be traced back by the authorities. The penalties for drug supply depend on the legal class the drug is, but they range from fines to prison sentences.</p>

											<p>Chelsea isn't keen to try it that night. What could Chelsea say to her friends?
											</p>
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option correct>
												<mcq-answer>
													<p>Tell them she doesn't want to take it on her birthday, and ask if they can plan a different night out to do it instead.
													</p>
												</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p><strong>Correct.</strong></p>
													<p>We will learn later in the module that the mindset someone is in when taking drugs can impact on how they experience the effects. Chelsea is already feeling a combination of excitement and nerves about the party, and this could easily tip over into anxiety. It's OK  to be clear with your friends about not wanting to use drugs. Chelsea could suggest they plan a separate time for her to try MDMA for the first time instead. Her friends should not be pressuring her to do something that she isn't sure about, and should respect her decision.</p>

											<p>Drinking alcohol after taking other drugs is:</p>
										</mcq-question>
										<mcq-options>
											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>
													<p>Fine as long as you drink a lot of water.
													</p>
												</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p><strong>Incorrect.</strong></p>
													<p>In most MDMA-related deaths, alcohol is also a contributing factor. When
														on
														MDMA,
														people feel like they have more energy and want to move or dance for
														long
														periods of time. MDMA also increases body temperature, and alcohol
														dehydrates
														the body. This combination increases the risk of heat stroke, which can
														be
														fatal. Additionally, alcohol reduces the MDMA 'high', meaning that
														people
														are
														more likely to overdose. </p>

											<p>What should Chelsea's friends do to minimise harm while taking MDMA?</p>

											<mcq-option incorrect>
												<mcq-answer>
													<p>Stop drinking and take the entire pill.
													</p>
												</mcq-answer>
												<mcq-feedback>
													<p><strong>Incorrect.</strong></p>
													<p>If they feel sure about taking the drug, they should ideally test the
														pill
														and check how much MDMA it contains. Even if the dose is low, they
														should all
														split the pills in (at least) half and then spread the doses throughout
														the night.
														Each person should gauge the dose depending on their weight (check the
														<em>'Useful links'</em> pod to learn more about this). They should also stick
														together &ndash;
														staying with people that you trust is important while on MDMA. If
														someone is
														tripping alone, they could get very confused, lose track of time or have
														an accident.
														It's also important to drink water appropriately to prevent dehydration
														or
														water intoxication (excessive water intake) and take regular breaks from
														the
														dancefloor.</p>

							<p>Chelsea's story shows how drugs can be used recreationally, but drugs are actually ever-present in daily life. Caffeine, paracetamol, alcohol, contraceptive pills... These substances are all classified as drugs because they cause a biological effect on the body when they are consumed.</p>
							<p>Some drugs have immediate effects while others take time to act. Some have psychological
								effects and others do not. Some are legal or regulated, while others are illegal. What
								should you know before consuming any drug?</p>

							<text-block>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Dose:</strong> The amount of drug that should be taken at a given time</li>
									<li><strong>Onset of effects:</strong> The time it takes for the drug to trigger a biological change</li>
									<li><strong>Effects:</strong> The biological changes that are triggered by the drug, including physical and
										psychological changes </li>
									<li><strong>Interactions:</strong> The way the drug might interact with other drugs in your system</li>
									<li><strong>Method:</strong> How the drug is being consumed</li>
									<li><strong>Duration:</strong> The length of time that the biological changes last in the body</li>
									<li><strong>Time in the system:</strong> The time it takes for your body to eliminate the drug.</li>
								</ul>

							<p>Knowledge is power. The more you know about something, the better informed you are to make

									<p>Drink spiking is when psychoactive drugs are added to drinks without consent or notice. These drugs are often used for sexual assault and robbery.</p>
									<p>Drugs used for spiking are depressants or dissociatives. Some known examples are GHB and Rohypnol. These drugs make you feel drowsy, uncoordinated and unaware, and make the victim more suggestible and vulnerable. We'll learn more about their effects on the screen titled: <em>Psychoactive rainbow</em>.</p>
									<p>You can follow these tips to reduce the chances of suffering from drink spiking:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Never leave your drinks unattended</li>
										<li>If someone offers to get you a drink, go with them and watch it being prepared
										</li>
										<li>Avoid sharing drinks</li>
										<li>Stay with your friends and look out for each other.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>If any of your friends disappears for a while or looks unexpectedly drunk or high, their drink may have been spiked. Keep a close eye on them, and don't leave them alone. The effects will most likely wear off after a few hours, but if you have concerns about their condition, call triple zero.</p>
