							<p>On any given day our social media feed may prompt us to take a quiz on 'Are you a toxic friend?' or 'Is your love legit?' But do quizzes and pop psychology in Instagram tags really help us understand how to relate to people? Let's start by looking at some myths around healthy and unhealthy relationships.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Select the tick or the cross according to whether you think the statement is correct or incorrect.</p></instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible><p>Consider the following statements and decide if you think they are correct or incorrect. Then proceed for feedback.</p></instructional-text-accessible>

									<p>Friends can't have abusive relationships. People would just walk away from toxic friends (i.e. friends that repeatedly put them down, criticise them, compete with them or make them feel inadequate, insecure or controlled).</p>

										<check-tick incorrect>Any relationship can be unhealthy or abusive if negative or destructive behaviours are present. It is about the bond between people and the power dynamics in that relationship, not the type of relationship itself.</check-tick>

										<reflection-question>How would you describe a healthy relationship?</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>Think about some positive key words or concepts that may apply to a healthy friendship or intimate relationship, or to the people involved. </reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>
											<p>The words we will associate with healthy relationships can also be used as foundations for all interactions in our professional and social lives.</p>
											<p>The key healthy relationship features we will cover are: <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>communication</strong>, <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>equality</strong>, <strong>freedom and enthusiasm</strong>, and <strong>fun and happiness</strong>. </p>

										<reflection-question>How would you describe an unhealthy relationship?</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>Think about some negative key words or concepts that may apply to an unhealthy friendship or intimate relationship, or to the people involved.</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>
											<p>Sadly, we are often able to more easily describe the features of negative relationships than we are healthy, positive relationships. This is due to a range of factors including media coverage of abusive relationships, a lack of positive role models and difficulties identifying and discussing healthy relationships.</p>
											<p>Some of the concepts we will look at for unhealthy relationships are: <strong>coercion</strong>, <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>guilt</strong>, <strong>manipulation</strong>, <strong>jealousy</strong>, <strong>control</strong>, <strong>intimidation</strong> and <strong>violence</strong>.</p>

										<reflection-question>Would you feel comfortable saying something to a friend if you thought they were in an unhealthy relationship? What might you say?</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>Being a bystander to a difficult incident or situation is an uncomfortable position to be in, and it can be hard to know what to do. Taking the role of a positive bystander doesn't have to mean taking a huge stand or intervening in a violent situation. It can be as simple as a quiet word at the right time.</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>Being empathetic and non-judgemental is key to being a positive bystander. We will look at some skill-building activities throughout this module to help you be a confident and effective positive bystander. We'll also give you some resources you can call on if you, or someone you know, are in an unhealthy relationship. </reflection-feedback>

									<reflection>
										<reflection-question>Would you feel comfortable saying something to a friend if you saw them treating someone badly in a relationship? What might you say?</reflection-question>
										<reflection-hint>This is a really hard one and being a positive bystander should never place you or anyone else in an unsafe situation. Again, it can be as simple as saying the right thing in the right way.</reflection-hint>
										<reflection-feedback>Having difficult conversations with friends about their behaviour is never going to be something we want to do. But, we know we have to because we don't want them to harm others or themselves. Without someone who cares about them saying something, they may not realise their behaviour is harmful. It could be the catalyst for them to change and create a healthy relationship in future.</reflection-feedback>

							<p>Hopefully these activities have given you a chance to reflect on your own ideas around healthy and unhealthy relationships. As we move through the module, we will dive deeper into the features of healthy relationships.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>Bad friends can be just as destructive to your self-esteem as a bad boyfriend, maybe even worse. With boyfriends you can usually see if they are just using you for sex or something, but a friend who is using you to make themselves feel good is much harder to see. Toxic friends make you feel insecure, like you should feel lucky to have someone like them as your friend because you are so unworthy. No matter what you do, you fall short.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Maddi, 20</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I used to hate going home in the university breaks. It wasn't until I left home that I realised how mean my older brother and sister were and how bad they made me feel about myself. They still live near my parents and they call me "the crazy one" or "the know-it-all". It has got worse the more I have studied. I've lived with them making comments like this all my life so I thought it was normal. I didn't realise bullies could be in your family.</p></pod-quote>
