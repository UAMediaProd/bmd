							<p>There are many opinions about whether people should be able to behave in a certain way online, or say things online, that they would not say to someone in person. Some things may be considered offensive, but are not illegal; but words can become malicious or hateful communications, which <strong>can be</strong> illegal under federal law if they relate to race or origin. Some state laws outlaw hate speech targeting other characteristics such as religion, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation too.</p>
							<p>Students may experience offensive behaviour during university life. Universities may address this in the student code or university code of conduct.</p>
							<p>It is important to understand the difference between something people might find offensive,
								but which is allowable due to freedom of speech or expression, and when something is malicious
								and potentially illegal. There are some things that are defined by law as <em>protected characteristics</em>, and these are
								illegal to discriminate against</p>

							<p>Sometimes people say hurtful and aggressive things online, using their freedom of speech or expression as a justification for their actions. It is true that we all have the right to freedom of speech or expression. However, if that expression attacks someone because of protected characteristics or there are threats of illegal activity, such as violence, this can be defined as 'malicious communication'.</p>

									<node-content>There is a balance between something that is considered offensive, but is

										<node-heading>"Everyone on disability support pension is a fraud"</node-heading>

										<node-heading>"Vietnamese should not be let into our country"</node-heading>

										<node-heading>"Children should not be taught about LGBT+ issues in school"</node-heading>
										<node-content>This is not hate speech. It is an offensive opinion about the teaching

											against the LGBT+ community or individuals directly. </node-content>

									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>"Stand up against the Islamification of our country"</node-heading>
										<node-content>This is a hateful communication because it is encouraging others to

									<concept-node>
										<node-heading>"Jenny is a slut and here's a photo to prove it"</node-heading>
