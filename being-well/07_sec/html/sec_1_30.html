							<p>As we have already explored, your self-esteem is based on several different factors. A strong influence on how you feel about yourself is what you 'say' to yourself, or your <glossary placement="bottom" content="We all 'talk' to ourselves and what we 'say' has an influence on how we feel and behave. This is often called 'self-talk'. Think of your internal monologue as a script in your head; we all follow different scripts for different occasions. These scripts often become so ingrained that we say to ourselves <q>I did this before so I must do the same again</q>.">internal monologue</glossary>.  It is important to recognise when your self-talk is unhelpful, as you can learn to change your response to this inner voice and even to change what the voice is saying.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Select a student and choose one of the responses provided to assign to their internal monologue. Then read our feedback to see how their self-talk influenced their reaction to the situation. You could also look back at the alternative option to see how this response might have changed things.</p></instructional-text>

									<action-question>Rachel is stepping up to take an important penalty kick in a soccer game. She's been a soccer player for a long time and is considered a good player by her teammates.</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="2">"I cannot do this, I'm crap at shooting. Everyone is watching. I'll let the team down and they'll hate me."</action-link>

									<h4>Unhelpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>By focusing on what can go wrong, Rachel is increasing the pressure on herself. Notice that in a few short steps Rachel has linked missing a penalty to people hating her. That is an irrational, but powerful, thought process. When Rachel tells herself that she cannot succeed, her thought process is focused on the anticipation of failure rather than how she needs to perform in this moment. Should Rachel be successful in scoring her penalty, she is almost certainly going to put that success down to luck rather than her skill &ndash; her negative self-talk does not allow the possibility that she scored the goal because she is a good soccer player.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="3" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Helpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>Rachel normalises her feelings as appropriate for this challenging situation. She checks her experience to find positive reinforcement in the form of acknowledging her hard work and good performances in the past. Importantly, Rachel then addresses what she needs to do in order to succeed in this situation. She decides on where to shoot and thinks about the actions she needs to take. She uses deep breathing to help calm herself and reaches for encouraging thoughts. Focusing on her actions rather than possible future consequences makes it more likely she will succeed. If she scores, she will own the glory; if she misses, she will review her actions to see what she can improve next time.</p>

								<action-panel panel="4" is-white-padded="true">
									<action-question>Aaron is in an argument with his housemates about how to split the bills. He was the one who originally set up the bills and direct debits for the group, but is now considering just paying them off himself to end the conflict.</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="5">"This is terrible; we're all shouting at each other. We used to be such good friends but now all we do is fight. How am I going to live with these guys for the rest of the year?"</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="6">"Well this isn't going well. But they will calm down and then we can talk again. We are all responsible for making this work. I need to contribute to the solution but not take it all on. What is a reasonable approach?"</action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="5" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Unhelpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>Aaron really wants to end the conflict. He feels upset that it has come to this after all he has done to organise the payments for the group, and he has a right to feel disappointed. However, Aaron is allowing his negative thought process to spiral, and is thinking of the worst possible scenarios rather than trying to search for a positive solution.</p>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="6" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Helpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>Aaron really wants to end this conflict, but he recognises that this is a group problem and not one he should own. Aaron knows that certain things are said in arguments that people might not mean and that, given the shouting going on, the issue is not going to be resolved tonight. Aaron can break up the argument, saying it is hard to be constructive when emotions are heightened; he can ask his housemates to sleep on it and have a think about possible solutions. He knows a decision does not have to be made this instant.</p>

								<action-panel panel="7" is-white-padded="true">
									<action-question>Kim is reading constructive but critical feedback from a lecturer on one of her assignments. It's her first piece of work as a postgraduate student, having achieved top marks during her undergraduate studies. </action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="8">"Wow, look at all the red lines and comments the lecturer has made. It is clear she thinks this is sub-standard work and that I am not capable. Maybe I'm just not clever enough to be here. If my first piece of work at this level is so bad, how am I going to cope when the course gets harder?" </action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="9">"Wow, look at all the red lines and comments the lecturer has made. Clearly, I have a lot to learn about writing to postgraduate level. There are some helpful comments here I can learn from and she has praised some of my insights and analysis, so it isn't all bad." </action-link>
								</action-panel>
								<action-panel panel="8" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Unhelpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>Kim is used to doing very well academically and puts a lot of pressure on herself to achieve high standards. For so long, she has told herself (and been told) that she is clever and so should get top marks straight away. Kim has a mindset that believes attributes (e.g. intelligence) are fixed &ndash; so, in her view, people are clever or they are not clever. In the face of criticism, the other side of her perfectionistic thinking kicks in and she flips into catastrophically thinking she cannot be good academically. This 'perfect or crap' thinking makes it very difficult for students to rise to the challenge of higher education, as neither end of the spectrum is helpful. Perfectionism is explored more thoroughly in the module titled: <em>Am I good enough?.</em></p>

								<action-panel panel="9" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Helpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>Kim is used to doing very well academically and puts a lot of pressure on herself to achieve high standards. She understands, though, that studying for a postgraduate degree is a step up for her, and it will take time to fully understand what she needs to do. She is hurt by the criticism from her lecturer, but she recognises that this is a great learning opportunity for her. She can take a step away from her disappointment to see how she can improve in her next assignment. Kim is developing a growth mindset and knows that she will develop academically as she works hard and takes on the expert advice the university can offer.</p>

									<action-question>James is sitting in the exam hall about to start an exam. He's worked hard to prepare for the exam and revised all the material.</action-question>
									<action-link goto-panel="11">"I have prepared well for this. I had a good sleep last night, went for a run to wake me up and had a healthy breakfast. So, if I have done all the right things, why do I feel so sick in my stomach?"</action-link>
									<action-link goto-panel="12">"I can only do my best. I have worked hard for this. Sure, this first question is a tough one, but I need to keep calm. It is normal to be worried in an exam." </action-link>

								<action-panel panel="11" is-white-padded="true">
									<h4>Unhelpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>James acknowledges what he has done to this point to get ready for the exam, but his self-talk then focuses on why he feels nervous. He is asking himself why he feels sick given he has prepared so well. Many students take nerves as a sign that they are not going to do well, but feeling nervous about any big event is a normal (and usually helpful) human characteristic. James has a choice: to focus his self-talk on the nerves being proof he cannot do this, or to normalise the nerves as being what is usual in this situation &ndash; they will reduce as he gets into the work.</p>

									<h4>Helpful self-talk</h4>
									<p>James acknowledges what he has done to this point to get ready for the exam. He can see the challenges, as the first question is a hard one, but he rationalises this as being part of the need to test students. He also acknowledges that he feels nervous but that is OK because it is a normal response in situations like this. Normalising how he feels in this context is helpful and prevents nerves from taking over.</p>

							<p>Is your self-talk fair and kind? One way of answering this question is to think about what you would say to a friend and compare it to what you would say to yourself. If you are not already aware of your dominant self-talk then take some time to reflect on it over the next few days. A great way to practise hearing more encouraging self-talk is to always find at least two ways of interpreting the situations you have experienced.</p>
