							<p>There are a number of common sexual health concerns to be aware of. Some are sexually transmitted, while some are genital infections that can be caused by sex, or that you can just develop when your natural balances get upset.</p>
							<p>Pay attention to your body and if you notice any changes in appearance or smell, or if you have any pain or discomfort &ndash; get it checked out.</p>
							<p>STIs are often asymptomatic too (meaning they have no symptoms), so even if you don't have symptoms it's important to get STI tests &ndash; especially if you've had a new partner in the past few months.</p>

							<text-block>
								<p><strong>How often should you get tested for STIs? It depends on your situation:</strong></p>
								<ul>
									<li>It's recommended you get tested at least once a year if you're under 25 and sexually active</li>
									<li>If you're over 25 it's still a good idea to get tested every year or so, or when you change partners</li>
									<li>Gay and bisexual men who have had multiple partners should consider getting an STI and HIV test every three to six months</li>
									<li>If you and your partner want to stop using condoms/barriers it's a good idea for you both to get STI tests first.</li>
								</ul>

								<accessible-text><h4>Feedback</h4></accessible-text>
								<p>Keep an eye out for symptoms, and if you notice any get them checked right away. But remember that there may be no symptoms. If you have changed partners in the last one to three months regular testing is important, even if you don't think you have an infection. If you feel worried about getting tested, ask a partner or a friend to come with you and they could even get tested at the same time.</p>

							<h4>Where to get tested</h4>

							<p>Testing is usually free. You can get an STI test at a sexual health clinic. You can also get one from your GP or possibly at the university medical centre. There are also sexual health services targeted specifically at members of the LGBT+ community, so check what is available in your local area if this is relevant.</p>
							<p>Sexual health clinics are designed to be inclusive and non-judgemental places where you can get the services you need whatever your sexual preferences. For some services you can drop in without an appointment, and in some cases you may even be able to order a testing kit online, take the samples yourself at home, and post it back to be tested.</p>

							<!-- ACTIVITY START -->
							<process>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Go to a suitable clinic</h4>
									<p>Decide which clinic suits you best: GP, sexual health clinic or university medical centre. Many testing services are free, but if you're not sure then call beforehand to check. Make an appointment if necessary. Or check drop-in hours where you can go without an appointment.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Talk to the doctor or nurse</h4>
									<p>Once you arrive at your appointment you will be greeted by a doctor or nurse. They will ask you if you've been tested before, if you have any symptoms, if you've had an STI before, and a bit about your sex life and relationships. This is to work out which tests you should get.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Pee in a cup</h4>
									<p>What tests you need will depend on the kind of sex you're having, but will probably involve peeing in a cup. 
									Urine samples are used to test for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and some other infections.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Have swabs taken</h4>
									<p>It might also be necessary for swabs to be taken. This is a long cotton bud that can take a sample from the vagina, throat, the tip of the penis, or the anus. You may be able to swab the area yourself, or the health professional may take the swab.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Maybe get a rapid HIV test or a blood test</h4>
									<p>It is possible you will do a HIV test as well. You may do a rapid HIV test using your saliva or a pin-prick of blood from your finger. Or you may be asked to get a blood test. </p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Get your results</h4>
									<p>During your consultation the doctor or nurse will let you know how you will get your results, and when to expect them. This will usually be within a few days. Some clinics even provide HIV rapid testing where you only wait 20 minutes to get your results. You may get results by text message, phone call, or you may be asked to return in person for a follow-up appointment. Clinics also provide, or connect you with, counselling services if you need some additional support to process your diagnosis.</p>
								</process-page>
								<process-page>
									<h4>Get treatment</h4>
									<p>If you tested positive for any STIs you will get a prescription for treatment. Generally, the treatment is low cost with Medicare or on international students' OSHC. This may be a single pill, a course of antibiotics, a cream, or an ongoing treatment plan. It's important to take your medication correctly and to complete the treatments.</p>

							<p>It's common to feel nervous about going to get an STI test. You may feel worried about what will happen in the test, and what will happen if you get an STI diagnosis.</p>
							<p>Remember, your medical consultation will be private and confidential, and the staff are very experienced talking to patients about sexual health matters &ndash; they've seen it all before!</p>
							<p>Getting a positive result can be worrying and it's common to feel shame and possibly anger. STIs are common &ndash; a lot of people have had a positive diagnosis before. Many STIs are easily curable, and for others the symptoms can be controlled with treatment.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I felt so awkward about telling my new girlfriend about my STI diagnosis, but she was actually pretty cool about it. She got tested too, and luckily I hadn't passed it on to her.</p></pod-quote>

                                    <pod-quote><p>My friend told me he had gonorrhoea, and he wasn't sure if he'd got it from this guy he'd slept with, or maybe passed it on to him. He was embarrassed, so I helped him message the guy to let him know. At least he can now get tested too, and get treatment if he needs it.</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I was diagnosed with herpes last year. When I started seeing my boyfriend I had to tell him I had the virus &ndash; such an awkward conversation. We did some research and discussed what we should do. We're careful but can still be sexual together, and the relationship is going great.</p></pod-quote>
