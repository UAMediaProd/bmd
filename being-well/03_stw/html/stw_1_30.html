							<p>Procrastination &ndash; putting off something that needs to be done &ndash; is something we can all recognise from time to time, albeit in different ways and in response to different situations. For some people procrastination can be relatively fleeting and easily resolvable while, for others, it can become a pattern of behaviour that is evident in many personal and professional situations.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Consider the list of common situations a student might find themselves in during their studies. Reflect on how likely you might be to procrastinate in response to each of them. Click on the 'Almost certainly' button and then click on all of the items that you think belong in that category. Repeat this process for the other buttons.</p></instructional-text>

							<p>Can you see any connections between how you responded to different items? For example, are you more likely to procrastinate for course-related things, or social things; or do you have a tendency to procrastinate across the board? Also, are there underlying reasons that might contribute to you procrastinating, such as fear of failure, feeling overwhelmed, or feeling emotionally exposed or judged in a situation?</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I used to find all sorts of ways of putting off the things I didn't want to do, like finish an essay. I went to a free session organised by student services about combating procrastination, and the tips were helpful. I also find that giving myself rewards for completing tasks, like a night out with my mates, is a great motivator!</p></pod-quote>

									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>At the end of the year my current housemate decided to move out. The thought of finding someone to live with next year was really worrying me, so I just buried my head in the sand because there was no one who seemed an obvious choice. My friend suggested asking around at some of the societies I'm a member of, so I asked at my next footy match if anyone needed a housemate. One of the guys said his housemate was graduating and there was a room going in his house. I went round to see it and it was exactly what I needed, and such a weight off my mind to get my accommodation sorted.</p></pod-quote>
									<p class="text-note"><em>Ben, 20</em></p>
									<hr>
									<pod-quote><p>I knew I had this exam to do but I really didn't understand the material. The task seemed almost too big to deal with, so I avoided it. I was really struggling and mentioned as much to my friend after class. She said she was finding it difficult too, and suggested we go over the material to work it out together. We set up a few study sessions and managed to use our shared knowledge to get a better grip of the material. It was so helpful to know someone else was having the same concerns, and working as a team felt much more manageable than going through it all on my own.</p></pod-quote>

							<!-- ACTIVITY START -->
							<flashcards class="with-images">
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Arranging to meet up with friends or course mates at a social event</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">The thought might be: <em>Everyone is doing better/is more popular/is more interesting than me and so they will find me boring</em>. This type of procrastination is a fear of being judged and ultimately reinforces the fear because the person does not allow their fears to be proved wrong.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Arranging to meet with your subject tutor or lecturer</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">The thought might be: <em>They will think I am not good enough for my course/not contributing enough/I will sound stupid when I talk to them.</em> This can often be linked to 'imposter syndrome', where we feel that we are not as good as others think we might be and we are in the position from good luck, rather than good planning or hard work. Again, avoiding the situation reinforces the fear as the thoughts are never challenged. Imposter syndrome is explored in the module titled: <em>Postgraduate research student wellbeing.</em></flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Not attending lectures</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">The thought might be: <em>There's little point in attending as I don't learn anything new and find it quite boring.</em> We often need some energy to be able to undertake tasks, e.g. an interest or motivation in a subject. If it is hard to find that energy, perhaps due to disinterest, we can quickly begin to put it off and then withdraw.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
								<flashcard size="large">
									<flashcard-front variant="heading">Preparing a revision timetable</flashcard-front>
									<flashcard-back variant="text">The thought might be: <em>I have left this far too late to do any meaningful revision</em>. Sometimes we can have the best plans to be prepared and get going but other activities get in the way and we find ourselves running out of time. Feeling that little can be achieved &ndash; 'what's the point?' &ndash; can lead us to put this off even more.</flashcard-back>
								</flashcard>
							</flashcards>
							<!-- ACTIVITY END -->

							<p>As we can see, procrastination can present in many ways and in response to different situations. However, while we separated out personal and study-related issues to consider the thoughts behind them, we can see that the thoughts cross these boundaries &ndash; the way we think about ourselves personally will be significant in how we think about our studies, and vice versa.</p>
							<p>Intrusive negative thoughts and ideas for how to reframe your thinking are explored in the module titled: <em>Confidence, self-esteem and resilience.</em></p>
