							<p>As a student, possibly being away from home or dealing with loans for the first time, you will have a lot of financial considerations. Some students will also face a change in their financial situation as they move through university, and will need to develop a plan to ensure that any existing financial commitments can be honoured.</p>
							<p>The aim of this module is to introduce some key ideas to improve your financial awareness, and help to develop strategies to manage finances at university and beyond.</p>
							
							<instructional-text><p>Click to watch video interviews with students talking about how their understanding of money has changed while at university.</p></instructional-text>

											<p>You won't pay tax on earnings up to the tax-free threshold of &dollar;18,200 (19/20) if you are an Australian resident for tax purposes.
