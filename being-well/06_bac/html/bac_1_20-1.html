									<p>Try to take advantage of any green spaces at your university &ndash; for example, a sports field that isn't being used, or a campus lake that you can jog around. You can also use the architecture of your university creatively; maybe by running up and down a flight of outdoor steps in a quiet area, or using a bench for press-ups or plank exercises.</p>

									<flashcard-back variant="text">Physical benefits include a better immune system to fight infection, improved energy and sleep patterns, and maintaining a healthy weight. Adrenalin is released during physical activity, which restricts the blood vessels, increasing blood pressure and glucose levels. As a result, regular exercise contributes to a boost in energy levels. However, it's also important to take the time to relax and recover after exercise so as not to put too much pressure on the body.</flashcard-back>

									<flashcard-back variant="text">Exercise generates the release of 'feel good' chemicals (endorphins) in the brain, which lift mood, improve focus and provide a distraction from worries. The release of endorphins also helps to alleviate depression and anxiety, and the chemical dopamine creates feelings of pleasure and reward, which motivate you to repeat a specific behaviour.</flashcard-back>

									<flashcard-back variant="text">Exercising with others is a great way to strengthen existing relationships, and make new ones. Regular exercise increases testosterone levels, which helps to stimulate a person's libido and therefore their sex drive. Physical activity can also lead to improved perception of self-worth, which enhances our self-esteem.</flashcard-back>

							<p>People who are physically active tend to have more energy, sleep better, have a sharper memory, be more relaxed and have a more positive outlook on life. Physical activity can also be a powerful tool to help combat anxiety and ease the symptoms of depression (for more information on this, please see the module titled: <em>Stress, anxiety and depression</em>).</p>

							<p>A distinction can be made between benefits of exercise to both 'mind' and 'body'. However, when considering mental and physical health, these areas should not be thought of separately. Even though your priorities as a student will change over time, staying physically active will give you a better chance of achieving your goals.</p>

							<p>If the activities on this screen have highlighted areas of your mental wellbeing that could be improved, consider trying the modules in the <em>Feeling Well</em> strand. These modules look at common issues affecting students' mental health, and offer advice for coping strategies and where to seek help.</p>
