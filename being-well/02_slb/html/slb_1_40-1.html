							<p>Getting good sleep, and enough of it, is fundamental to functioning well in many aspects of
								life, including concentration, energy, mood and mental health. Given its importance, attitudes towards and knowledge about sleep can be surprisingly poor, as if it is a throw-away commodity that most of us can choose to do without. In reality, sleep is
								the mechanism that helps the body and the mind to repair, renew and refresh, consolidating
								memories and learning. If you have a great lecture in which you learn something new, it will
								stay with you better after a good night's sleep.</p>
							<p>Sleep is something that most of us expect to happen without having to think about it. This
								leads to some assumptions about sleep that need looking at further.</p>

													<p>Sleep problems are associated with a number of common mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depression. Feeling low and anxious can impact on how well you sleep.

													<p>It is true that throughout history some people have just seemed to need less sleep. But even if it is the case, it is exceptional and very much not what most people experience.

This doesn't mean that people can't manage on less &ndash; some people, like new parents, have no choice. But there will always be an impact. 'Powering through' may seem impressive, but it's not a sustainable strategy for the long run.</p>

									<pod-quote><p>I've always been a last-minute person, so would stay up all night to write an assignment, and think, "I'll catch up with sleep over the weekend". But the reality was I'd feel rubbish for days afterwards. Now, I do stay up late to meet deadlines but try and catch up with sleep as I go along rather than think I can parcel all the hours I'm owed into one big package for 'later'. It feels good to be working with my body rather than against it now.</p></pod-quote>

									<pod-quote><p>I'm an anxious person anyway, and this got worse in my first year. Part of it was the sleeping; because I was worried I couldn't sleep, and because I wasn't sleeping, I couldn't think straight and the worrying increased... My tutor noticed I was struggling and suggested I speak to student support services. We looked at ways to manage the stress. She helped me realise that sleep was when my brain got itself together and I started to value it, rather than see it as wasted time.  We looked at my sleep routine and how I could help myself to relax in the evening and prepare my body for rest.</p></pod-quote>

							<p>Few people have perfect sleep all of the time. How well you sleep depends on lots of things, from genes to learned patterns of sleeping, to what's happening in your life in this moment. <glossary content="How people normally sleep, which is informed by genetic, environmental and behavioural factors. Sleep patterns are not fixed and can change when behaviour and environment are addressed.">Sleep patterns</glossary> can be disrupted by lots of things &ndash; working shifts, young children, 'all-nighters' and persistent disruptions caused by the sleeping environment.</p>
							<p>Poor sleep can affect several areas of life, in ways that are not always obvious. Sometimes it is only the people around the sleep-deprived person who can really see what's going on, whilst the person themselves might feel they are coping OK. Or they may see the problem very well, but not be sure what they can do to solve it.</p>

							<p>Of course, sleep may not always be the cause &ndash; or the answer &ndash; to some of these issues. But it is a possible contributor, just as it is a possible solution. Knowing your own sleep patterns, and thinking about the areas that poor sleep can commonly affect, is a good starting point to taking action to improve things.</p>
