							<p>Another way to save money is to look at how you do your grocery shopping. Even if you do not currently buy your own food (perhaps you live with family, or in catered accommodation), it can still be a useful exercise to think about your spending. The module titled: <em>Eating well</em> looks at planning healthy meals when living on a student budget.</p>

							<instructional-text><p>Consider the list of 10 common items you may add to a weekly shop. Using the website of your local or preferred supermarket, look up the price of a branded version of each item (e.g. Buttercup for the loaf of bread) and record the amount in the 'Branded' column. Then look up the price of the same item in the supermarket's 'own brand' range (e.g. Aldi's sliced bread) and record the amount in the 'own brand' column. The check the 'Grand total' row to see the difference in overall cost.</p></instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible>
								<p>For this activity, you'll need a calculator. Consider the list of ten common items you may add to a weekly shop in the sample table below. Using the website of your local or preferred supermarket, look up the price of a branded version of each item (e.g. Buttercup for a loaf of bread) and record the amount in the 'Branded' products. Calculate the total cost of these products and make a note of the figure.</p>
								<p>Then look up the price of the same item in the supermarket's 'own brand' range (e.g. Aldi's sliced bread) and record the amount for the 'Own brand' products. Calculate the total cost of these products and make a note of the figure.</p>
								<p>Compare the difference in overall cost of the 'Branded' products to the total cost of the 'Own brand' products to see how much you can save.</p>

							<p>This overall saving might not seem that impressive as a one-off, but when you consider how this could add up over a month or a year, it could make a real difference to overall expenditure.</p>
							<p>Think carefully about where and when you shop &ndash; many supermarkets will discount foods at the end of the day. You can also consider sharing some costs with housemates and buying in bulk (this is often cheaper), and possibly taking turns to cook for the whole household to reduce the cost per portion.</p>
