							<p>A harm reduction approach aims to reduce the risks associated with drug use by introducing protective factors. It uses pragmatic, realistic and honest strategies that respect people's ability to make their own decisions.</p>
							<p>How much do you know about staying safe in relation to drug-taking?</p>

									<p>Correct. There are many reasons why mixing alcohol with stimulant and empathogen
										drugs is a bad idea. Stimulants make you feel euphoric, energetic and
										overconfident. In this state, people are more likely to drink more alcohol and can
										therefore overdose more easily. Additionally, the most common stimulant &ndash; cocaine &ndash;  combines with alcohol in the body to form a compound that is damaging to the liver. When alcohol is combined with empathogens, the 'high' is reduced. This is very misleading, and people may take more empathogen drugs than they should, increasing the chances of overdose or bad experiences.</p>

However, testing kits are not fool proof. They will only tell you if they detect the presence of a limited amount of other substances and they will never tell you the purity (the amount of a particular chemical compound in a substance).

								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>The space you are in is as important as your mindset. It is highly recommended that you think carefully about where you are going to consume psychedelics. Avoid images and spaces that trigger negative emotions for you. Ideally, you should prepare the space in advance, so it is psychologically soothing, and it enhances your wellbeing and the wellbeing of those with you.</p>

								<h4>Question 3:</h4>
								<p>If a friend is having a bad experience, remind them that they are hallucinating.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>True</li>
									<li>False</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>The correct answer is:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>False</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>Someone that has taken too much of a psychedelic substance will probably make little sense, hallucinate and have vacant eyes. Never tell someone under the influence of psychedelics that they are hallucinating. This will make them feel even worse, leading to anxiety. Try to follow their thought process. They are in a very vulnerable state, so it is easy to influence their thinking and emotions. For example, if they think someone is following them, tell them that you know a safe place to hide and that everything is going to be OK. Bring them to a safe, quiet space and stay with them until the effects wear off.</p>

								<h3>Dissociatives and depressants</h3>
								<h4>Question 1:</h4>
								<p>These drugs are safe to combine with each other as well as others.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>True</li>
									<li>False</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>The correct answer is:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>False</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>As we learnt earlier, depressants are drugs that reduce stimulation and arousal, whereas dissociatives produce the feeling that the mind detaches from the body and the environment. Both of these drugs combine quite badly with any substance, but it can be extremely unsafe to mix them. Depressant plus depressant is dangerous as it can slow down your brain and body too much, resulting in fainting or even coma. Dissociative plus dissociative can have a similar effect and makes accidents more likely due to reduced coordination.</p>
								<p>Continue to <strong>Question 2.</strong></p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Question 2:</h4>
								<p>If a friend has taken too much of any of these substances, try to keep them upright and stay with them.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>True</li>
									<li>False</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>The correct answer is:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>True</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>When people are too drunk or have taken too much ketamine, they look confused, and lack awareness and coordination. They are not going to care much about what is going on around them, and it could be a very embarrassing situation to be in. Take them somewhere calm and quiet, keep them upright and make them comfortable. Keep them awake and conscious!</p>
								<p>Continue to <strong>Question 3.</strong></p>
								<hr>
								<h4>Question 3:</h4>
								<p>If a friend needs to be taken to the hospital because they have passed out after taking any of these substances, don't tell the medical professionals about all the substances that your friend has consumed.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>True</li>
									<li>False</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>The correct answer is:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>False</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Feedback:</h4>
								<p>In Australia, all patients have the right to a confidential medical service no matter what type of drug has been consumed. When seeking help, it's important to give as much information as possible. This will help professionals to act quickly and reduce the chances of major harm. Helpful information includes the amount taken, the colour and shape of the drug, and where it was obtained. The ambulance office, doctor or hospital will not call the police just because someone has taken an illicit drug, unless they are violent or committing some other crime. Medical professionals may feel obliged to disclose the information if there is a major incident, such as a death.</p>

									<p>If you are concerned that your friend is having a bad experience with drugs, the most
										important thing is to seek medical attention. However, there are some practical
										things you can do to help them: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>If they are on <strong>stimulants or empathogens</strong>, bring them to a quiet and calm place, and slow them down physically and mentally </li>
										<li>If they are on <strong>psychedelics</strong>, never tell them they are hallucinating. Follow what they are saying and bring them to a quiet and safe space, and stay with them</li>
										<li>If they are on <strong>dissociatives or depressants</strong>, keep them awake and in a comfortable position, so they don't accidently hurt themselves.</li>

							<p>The harm reduction approach is gaining popularity worldwide and there is evidence to suggest that it actually works better than more punitive approaches.</p>
							<p>The best way to avoid the harm of drugs is not to take them, and you should always respect your friends' decisions if they choose not to take drugs. If you choose not to take drugs yourself, you can be an effective friend or bystander for others by maintaining a non-judgemental approach and offering support for harm reduction strategies.</p>
