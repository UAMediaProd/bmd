							<p>This module will look at the cost of going to university and the different types of funding that are available to support you. We'll explore what your tuition fees cover and what additional costs you might incur as part of your course, as well as government assistance and various types of <glossary placement="bottom" content="Money that is borrowed and needs to be repaid over a specified period, almost always with interest (an additional amount accrued on top of the original sum).">loans</glossary> and <glossary placement="bottom" content="Contributions of money that do not have to be repaid. Grants may be awarded on the grounds of academic excellence, sporting excellence, financial hardship or to students with disabilities. All students, including domestic, Indigenous and international students may be eligible.">grants</glossary> that you might be eligible for as a student.</p>
							<p>Some universities offer loans and grants that international students may be able to access, and it is best to check with your university to see if you are eligible.</p>
							<p>All students will pay tuition fees, often with the assistance of the <glossary placement="bottom" content="A loan to help pay for tuition fees and amenities fees when attending university, or an approved higher education provider. These loans to do not cover additional costs, such as accommodation or text books.">HELP</glossary> loan scheme, but are you sure what they are actually supposed to cover?</p>

								<p>If you are an Australian student, the type of loans you will qualify for will depend on a number of factors.</p>
								<p>A student who has a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) can borrow up to the combined HELP limit to pay tuition fees: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>This includes all FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and VET Student Loans, as well as any HECS-HELP loans from 1/1/20. In 2020, this limit is &dollar;106,319, although there is a higher limit for some courses</li>
									<li>The amount of tuition fee per topic for students in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) depends on which student contribution band your study area is in</li>
									<li>Some students who are permanent residents of Australia on certain visa types are eligible for Commonwealth Supported Places and/or HELP loans</li>
									<li>Loans are available for both tuition fees, and student services and amenities fees.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you are an international student or temporary resident, you will pay a higher tuition fee. The rates are set by the individual universities.</p>
								<p>See the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod for further information on these points. It's important to know exactly how much your fees are, and if you aren't eligible for any of the HELP loans, to know what your options are to pay them.</p>

								<reflection-feedback>Australian citizens and some permanent residents are eligible for HELP loans from the Australian Government. When you first enrol, you will complete the appropriate documentation, which your university provides. After the census date, the fees will be applied to your HELP loan account. Temporary residents and international students pay their fees upfront &ndash; sometimes themselves, or with help from their home government, or a sponsor.</reflection-feedback>
