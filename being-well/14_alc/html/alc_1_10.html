							<p>"Hi, how're you going? We haven't talked in ages! Let's catch up for a drink!"</p>
							<p>You have probably heard this or something similar before. Have you ever heard people say that "humans are social animals"? Well, alcohol serves as a social lubricant, which combined with our social nature might explain why alcohol is so popular among students, as well as the population more generally. However, more people than ever are now choosing to reduce their levels of drinking, or choosing not to drink at all, particularly adults under 25 years of age (Australian Institute for Health and Welfare, 2017). Universities and students' associations have raised awareness of risky drinking, and there are now more options for social events and interactions that do not involve alcohol.</p>
							<p>Let's start by thinking about why people might drink alcohol, or choose not to.</p>

							<instructional-text class="hide-in-mobile">
								<p>Look at the following scenarios and reflect on the motivations to drink alcohol in each
									situation. Think about the social context and the emotions the students might be
									feeling. Then, make a note of your answer. Finally, click for feedback.</p>
							</instructional-text>
							<instructional-text-accessible class="show-in-mobile"><p>Continue on for some scenarios and reflect on the motivations to drink alcohol in each situation. Think about the social context and the emotions the students might be feeling. For each question, consider your response, then proceed for feedback.</p></instructional-text-accessible>

												alcohol if they are having a 'serious' chat. Alcohol heightens emotions and
												reduces self-control. Therefore, starting an emotionally charged

											<p>He could be using alcohol to try to feel better about himself or a difficult situation ('drowning his sorrows'). He could also be drinking because he feels bored or lonely.

											<p>They are celebrating the end of exams. It can be a relief to finish the exam season and start the uni break. While it is fun to celebrate by partying with your friends, there are a few things to watch out for. A high percentage of alcohol-related accidents occur after exams are finished. If you've reduced how much you drink during the semester to focus on studying, your tolerance to the effects of alcohol might be very low. Try to keep track of how much you're drinking, and avoid promotions like 2 for 1 drinks or cheap shots. These can make you feel pressure to drink more.</p>

												choose to avoid alcohol altogether. Or perhaps they haven't met up for a
												while and want to catch up properly without the buzz of alcohol. Some people

												dancing instead of lining up at the bar. </p>

Alcohol comes from fermenting natural sugar and starch, which is why it contains many calories. These are said to be 'empty calories' because they don't include many nutrients that contribute to your diet. Check the calories in different beverages using a calories calculator, like the one in the <em>'Useful links'</em> pod.</p>
